The anatomy and physiology that make this happen varies greatly, depending on the size of the organism, the environment in which it lives and its evolutionary history. In land animals the respiratory surface is internalized as linings of the lungs. Gas exchange in the lungs occurs in millions of small air sacs called alveoli in mammals and reptiles, but atria in birds. These microscopic air sacs have a very rich blood supply, thus bringing the air into close contact with the blood. These air sacs communicate with the external environment via a system of airways, or hollow tubes, of which the largest is the trachea, which branches in the middle of the chest into the two main bronchi. These enter the lungs where they branch into progressively narrower secondary and tertiary bronchi that branch into numerous smaller tubes, the bronchioles. In birds the bronchioles are termed parabronchi. It is the bronchioles, or parabronchi that generally open into the microscopic alveoli in mammals and atria in birds. Air has to be pumped from the environment into the alveoli or atria by the process of breathing which involves the muscles of respiration.\n  choice: What is the respiratory system?\n  choice: Where does gas exchange occur in land animals?\nChoose the appropriate question which has the given answer.", "targets": ["What is the respiratory system?"], "multiple_choice_targets": ["What is the respiratory system?", "Where does gas exchange occur in land animals?"]}, {"inputs": "Given a short answer along with its context, select the most appropriate question which has the given short answer as its answer.\n\nHere is the short answer followed by the context.\nShort Answer: Earth's mantle Context: The mantle is a layer inside a terrestrial planet and some other rocky planetary bodies. For a mantle to form, the planetary body must be large enough to have undergone the process of planetary differentiation by density. The mantle lies between the core below and the crust above. The terrestrial planets, including Earth, formed by accretion from a disk of material in orbit around the Sun. Over time, the molten interior of Earth (and other rocky planets) differentiated into layers by density, largely due to gravitational sorting of materials as they cooled and solidified. The highest-density material (mostly metals like iron and nickel) sank to the center, whereas lower-density material (such as silicates) accumulated on the surface. The core, consisting primarily of iron and nickel, is denser than the mantle and so was pulled toward the center during this sorting. Similarly, the less dense crust floated atop the denser mantle. Because the crust is relatively rigid and brittle compared with the mantle, it is broken into tectonic plates that move. Surface heat flow through the tectonic plates provides a geothermal gradient, which drives plate motion via convection in the underlying mantle.\n  choice: What is the mantle?\n  choice: What is the highest-density material in Earth's interior?\nChoose the appropriate question which has the given answer.", "targets": ["What is the mantle?"], "multiple_choice_targets": ["What is the mantle?", "What is the highest-density material in Earth's interior?"]}, {"inputs": "Given a short answer along with its context, select the most appropriate question which has the given short answer as its answer.\n\nHere is the short answer followed by the context.\nShort Answer: Jupiter Context: Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System.

To function properly, an immune system must detect a wide variety of agents, known as pathogens, from viruses to parasitic worms, and distinguish them from the organism's own healthy tissue. In many species, there are two major subsystems of the immune system: the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system. Both subsystems use humoral immunity and cell-mediated immunity to perform their functions. In humans, the blood\u2013brain barrier, blood\u2013cerebrospinal fluid barrier, and similar fluid\u2013brain barriers separate the peripheral immune system from the neuroimmune system, which protects the brain.\n  choice: What is the immune system?\n  choice: What are the two major subsystems of the immune system?\nChoose the appropriate question which has the given answer.", "targets": ["What is the immune system?"], "multiple_choice_targets": ["What is the immune system?", "What are the two major subsystems of the immune system?"]}, {"inputs": "Given a short answer along with its context, select the most appropriate question which has the given short answer as its answer.\n\nHere is the short answer followed by the context.\nShort Answer: The Great Wall of China Context: The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications made of stone, brick, tamped earth, wood, and other materials, generally built along an east-to-west line across the historical northern borders of China to protect the Chinese states and empires against the raids and invasions of the various nomadic groups of the Eurasian Steppe.

It is evoked by light which has a dominant wavelength of roughly 495\u2013570 nm. In subtractive color systems, used in painting and color printing, it is created by a combination of yellow and blue, or yellow and cyan; in the RGB color model, used on television and computer screens, it is one of the additive primary colors, along with red and blue, which are mixed in different combinations to create all other colors. By far the largest contributor to green in nature is chlorophyll, the chemical by which plants photosynthesize and convert sunlight into energy.

It is the fifth-largest satellite in the Solar System, and by far the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits. The Moon is thought to have formed about 4.5 billion years ago, not long after Earth. There are several hypotheses for its origin; the most widely accepted explanation is that the Moon formed from the debris left over after a Mars-sized object collided with Earth. The Moon is in synchronous rotation with Earth, meaning that the same side is always facing the Earth. The first human landing on the Moon was on July 20, 1969, during the Apollo 11 mission, when astronauts Neil Armstrong and Edwin \"Buzz\" Aldrin became the first humans to walk on the Moon.

FitzRoy had already thought of the advantages of having someone on board who could record his scientific observations and upon reading Charles Darwin\u2019s Journal of Researches, he proposed to Darwin that he take on this role. Aboard the Beagle, Darwin carefully collected and described specimens, and he closely observed the geography and geology of the places he visited.

Although the Reformation is usually considered to have started with the publication of the Ninety-five Theses by Martin Luther in 1517, there was no schism between the Catholic Church and the nascent Luther until the 1521 Edict of Worms. The edict condemned Luther and officially banned citizens of the Holy Roman Empire from defending or propagating his ideas. The end of the Reformation era is disputed: it could be considered to end with the enactment of the confessions of faith which began the Age of Orthodoxy. Other suggested ending years relate to the Counter-Reformation, the Peace of Westphalia, or that it never ended since there are still Protestants today.\n  choice: What was the movement within Western Christianity in the 16th century that posed a religious and political challenge to the Roman Catholic Church?\n  choice: Who published the Ninety-five Theses in 1517?\nChoose the appropriate question which has the given answer.", "targets": ["What was the movement within Western Christianity in the 16th century that posed a religious and political challenge to the Roman Catholic Church?"], "multiple_choice_targets": ["What was the movement within Western Christianity in the 16th century that posed a religious and political challenge to the Roman Catholic Church?", "Who published the Ninety-five Theses in 1517?"]}, {"inputs": "Given a short answer along with its context, select the most appropriate question which has the given short answer as its answer.\n\nHere is the short answer followed by the context.\nShort Answer: Caffeine Context: Caffeine is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant of the methylxanthine class.

He also discovered that normal human bile contained two principal pigments, bilirubin and biliverdin, and showed that they were formed from hemoglobin. In 1823, Chevreul wrote a lengthy paper in which he described such previously unrecognized details of the process of soap-making that this paper became one of the foundations of modern chemistry. The soap-makers knew that they could boil fat with a strong alkali, but they did not know why it was that the mixture of fat and alkali produced soap. Chevreul explained that the reaction of soap-making involved the splitting of the triacylglycerols into fatty acids and glycerin, with the alkaline substance reacting with the fatty acids to produce the soap.\n  choice: Who discovered the correct structure of cholesterol?\n  choice: Who described the previously unrecognized details of soap-making?\nChoose the appropriate question which has the given answer.", "targets": ["Who described the previously unrecognized details of soap-making?"], "multiple_choice_targets": ["Who discovered the correct structure of cholesterol?", "Who described the previously unrecognized details of soap-making?"]}, {"inputs": "Given a short answer along with its context, select the most appropriate question which has the given short answer as its answer.\n\nHere is the short answer followed by the context.\nShort Answer: A blister agent Context: After the war, the Allies discovered stockpiles of mustard gas hidden in various locations, and they used captured German scientists to produce their own stocks of the weapon.
