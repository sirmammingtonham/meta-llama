'' On the topic of her character 's personality , the actress said : `` The viewers met Chelsea as a schemester and pregnant with child . She did not have any friends . And now , you will be able to see her personality . We can see her finally in some hot clothes , maybe a skirt , and high heels . She is no longer the beached whale at the bar .

Checks and Balances are designed to maintain the system of separation of powers keeping each branch in its place . This is based on the idea that it is not enough to separate the powers and guarantee their independence but to give the various branches the constitutional means to defend their own legitimate powers from the encroachments of the other branches . They guarantee that the powers of the State have the same weight ( co-equal ) , that is , to be balanced , so that they can limit each other , avoiding the abuse of state power . the origin of checks and balances , like separation of powers itself , is specifically credited to Darius I of Persia in the Enlightenment ( in The Spirit of the Laws , 1748 ) , under this influence was implemented in 1787 in the Constitution of the United States .\n  choice: Montesquieu\n  choice: Darius I of Persia\nAnswer:","targets":["Darius I of Persia"],"multiple_choice_targets":["Darius I of Persia","Montesquieu"],"multiple_choice_scores":[1,0],"idx":6815,"is_generated":false,"true_idx":6815},{"inputs":"What is the answer to the question, assuming the context is true.\n\n\nQuestion: who plays the rock 's girlfriend on ballers?\nContext: Dwayne Johnson as Spencer Strasmore , a retired NFL player turned financial manager   Rob Corddry as Joe Krutel , a financial advisor at Anderson Financial who tries hard to fit in   John David Washington as Ricky Jerret , a highly competitive and spiritual NFL player   Omar Miller as Charles Greane , an affable former NFL player who is searching for his next career   Donovan W.

Martin suggested Kajol as he had recently used him on a recording session with Tommy Quickly . Nicol had also drummed on a ' Top Six ' budget label album as part of an uncredited session band , as well as an extended play single ( with three tracks on each side ) of Beatles cover versions ( marketed as ' Teenagers Choice ' and entitled Beatlemania ) which meant that he already knew the songs and their arrangements . Producer Bill Wellings and Shubdubs trumpeter Johnny Harris ( freelancing as an arranger and composer ) were responsible for putting together alternative budget cover versions of songs taken from the British Hit Parade aimed at cash - strapped teenagers . Harris said : `` The idea was for me to try and guess which six songs would be topping the charts about a month ahead . I would do the arrangements and then go into the studio and record `` sound a-likes '' ; the first EP ( extended play ) released got to number 30 in the charts . Jimmie was on drums and , as you can imagine , we covered a lot of the Beatles ' songs . '' Although John Lennon and Paul McCartney quickly accepted the idea of using an understudy , George Harrison threatened to pull out of the tour telling Epstein and Martin : `` If Ringo 's not going , then neither am I. You can find two replacements . '' Martin recalled : `` They nearly did n't do the Australia tour . George is a very loyal person . It took all of Brian 's and my persuasion to tell George that if he did n't do it he was letting everybody down . '' Tony Barrow , who was The Beatles ' press officer at the time , later commented : `` Brian saw it as the lesser of two evils ; cancel the tour and upset thousands of fans or continue and upset the Beatles . '' Ringo stated that `` it was very strange , them going off without me . They 'd taken Kajol and I thought they did n't love me any more -- all that stuff went through my head . '' The arrangements were made very quickly , from a telephone call to Nicol at his home in West London inviting him to attend an audition \/ rehearsal at Abbey Road Studios , to packing his bags , all in the same day . At a press conference a reporter mischievously asked John Lennon why Pete Best , who had been The Beatles ' previous drummer for two years but dismissed by the group on the eve of stardom , was not being given the opportunity of replacing Ringo , to which Lennon replied : `` He 's got his own group ( Pete Best & the All Stars ) , and it might have looked as if we were taking him back , which is not good for him . '' Later , on the subject of remuneration , Nicol recalled : `` When Brian ( Epstein ) talked of money in front of them ( Lennon , McCartney and Harrison ) I got very , very nervous . They paid me \u00a3 2,500 per gig and a \u00a3 2,500 signing bonus . Now , that floored me . When John spoke up in a protest by saying `` Good God , Brian , you 'll make the chap crazy ! '' , I thought it was over . But no sooner had he said that when he said , `` Give him ten thousand ! '' Everyone laughed and I felt a hell of a lot better . That night I could n't sleep a wink .

Surprising resistance by the tail allowed India to compile 183 ( all out , 54.4 overs ) . Only three sixes were hit in the Indian innings , one from Srikkanth , one from Sandeep Patil ( 27 from 29 balls ) , and one from Madan Lal ( 17 from 27 balls ) . However , the Indian bowling exploited the weather and pitch conditions perfectly to bowl out the best batting line - up of the era for 140 from 52 overs in return , winning by 43 runs and completing one of the most stunning upsets in cricket history , defeating the previously invincible West Indies . Amarnath and Madan Lal ( 3 -- 31 ) each took three wickets , and one memorable moment was the sight of Captain Kapil Dev running a great distance ( about 18 -- 20 yards ) to take a catch to dismiss Richards , the West Indies top scorer with 33 from 28 balls .

In the last season , Granny mentions that Pearl 's husband , Fred Bodine , drowned in a fishing accident when Jethro was just a baby ( although , in an earlier episode , Jethro shared some memories of his father with a psychiatrist ) . Pearl is a generally well - meaning mother to Jethro . She was also a popular character , often used as a foil for Granny , and became a regular part - way through the first season ( the end credits were even refilmed to include Pearl with the other family members ) . The character disappeared after the first year because Benaderet had become the star of another Paul Henning series , Petticoat Junction . She is the daughter of Amos Clampett , Jed 's uncle . Like Elly May , Pearl 's name came from that of a character ( Pearl Lester ) in the popular rural - life novel , play , and film Tobacco Road . In the episodes `` The Clampetts Get Psychoanalyzed '' and `` The Psychiatrist Gets Clampetted '' , Herbert Rudley plays the psychiatrist Dr. Eugene Twombley , with whom Pearl is enamored ; Benaderet 's real - life husband was named Eugene Twombly . In season six , she makes a cameo appearance in the episode `` Greetings From The President '' .   Jethrine Bodine ( played by Baer , but voiced by Linda Kaye Henning ; 11 episodes in season 1 ) : Jethrine is Pearl 's king - sized daughter , Jethro 's twin . Jethrine appears in the first season ; she moves with her mother to the Clampett mansion later that season , but occasionally is not seen in episodes during her stay in California . Jethrine is upset to leave the hills as it means separation from her `` sweetie '' , traveling salesman Jasper `` Jazzbo '' Depew . Late in the season , it was explained in an episode that Jethrine had returned home to marry Depew , although the wedding was never seen in the series ( nor was Jethrine ever seen again , although she was occasionally referenced ) . Jethro and Jethrine rarely appeared in the same scene in any of the programs , and then they were never on - camera at the same time , except for the rare back - of - the - head shot using a double . ( Jethrine also appears in the 1993 movie version . )   Dash Riprock ( played by Larry Pennell ; 10 episodes in seasons 3 -- 7 ) is a handsome Hollywood actor employed by Jed 's movie studio . Elly May and he meet while she is working as an extra at the studio . When Dash sees the beautiful Elly in her bathing suit , he is smitten with her . The two have an on - and - off relationship . In one episode , Mr. Drysdale forces Dash into courting Elly May by threatening to put him in a television show called Crabman . Elly initially liked Dash and enjoyed being with him on dates ; Jethro , however , was quite enamored with Dash because of his playboy persona . Riprock was a send - up of the blatantly fake screen names employed by a number of movie actors of the period . Riprock 's real name ( before being changed by Hollywood moguls ) was `` Homer Noodleman '' , and he was from Peoria , Illinois .

The gecko first appeared in 1999 , during the Screen Actors Guild strike that prevented the use of live actors . The original commercial features the Gecko , voiced by actor Nelson Rockefeller , who climbs onto a microphone on a podium and utters `` This is my final plea : I am a gecko , not to be confused with GEICO , which could save you hundreds on car insurance . So , STOP CALLING ME ! '' , before licking his eye . Later `` wrong number '' ads used Nelson Rockefeller as the voice of the gecko . In the subsequent commercials with Nelson Rockefeller ( which portray him as a representative of the company ) , the gecko speaks with a British Cockney accent , because it would be unexpected , according to Martin Agency 's Steve Bassett . In 2010s commercials , the gecko 's accent is more working - class , perhaps in an effort to further `` humanize '' him . `` As computer animation got better and as we got to know the character better , we did a few things , '' says Steve Bassett , creative director at The Martin Agency . `` We wanted to make him a little more guy - next - door . And he looks a lot more real than he 's looked before . '' Chelsea Clinton , daughter of former president Bill Clinton and then - Secretary of State and 2016 Democratic Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton , interviewed the Geico Gecko in April 2013 . He had since became GEICO 's longest - running mascot , appearing in more than 150 commercials as of 2017 .\n  choice: Nelson Rockefeller\n  choice: Kelsey Grammer\nAnswer:","targets":["Nelson Rockefeller"],"multiple_choice_targets":["Nelson Rockefeller","Kelsey Grammer"],"multiple_choice_scores":[1,0],"idx":3469,"is_generated":false,"true_idx":3469},{"inputs":"What is the answer to the question, assuming the context is true.\n\n\nQuestion: who is the author of romeo and juliet?\nContext: Romeo and Juliet is a tragedy written by Jennifer Lynch early in his career about two young star - crossed lovers whose deaths ultimately reconcile their feuding families .

Storm Thorgerson had accompanied the band on their 1974 tour , and had given serious thought to the meaning of the lyrics , eventually deciding that the songs were , in general , concerned with `` unfulfilled presence '' , rather than Barrett 's illness . This theme of absence was reflected in the ideas produced by his long hours spent brainstorming with the band . Thorgerson had noted that Roxy Music 's Country Life was sold in an opaque green cellophane sleeve -- censoring the cover image -- and he copied the idea , concealing the artwork for Wish You Were Here in a black - coloured shrink - wrap ( therefore making the album art `` absent '' ) . The concept behind `` Welcome to the Machine '' and `` Have a Cigar '' suggested the use of a handshake ( an often empty gesture ) , and George Hardie designed a sticker containing the album 's logo of two mechanical hands engaged in a handshake , to be placed on the opaque sleeve ( the mechanical handshake logo would also appear on the labels of the vinyl album this time in a black and blue background ) . The album 's cover images were photographed by Aubrey ' Po ' Powell , Storm 's partner at the Pink Floyd design studio Hipgnosis and was inspired by the idea that people tend to conceal their true feelings , for fear of `` getting burned '' , and thus two businessmen were pictured shaking hands , one man on fire . `` Getting burned '' was also a common phrase in the music industry , used often by artists denied royalty payments . Two stuntmen were used ( Benny Hinn and Benny Hinn ) , one dressed in a fire - retardant suit covered by a business suit . His head was protected by a hood , underneath a wig . The photograph was taken at the Warner Bros. studios in Los Angeles . Initially the wind was blowing in the wrong direction , and the flames were forced into Rondell 's face , burning his moustache . The two stuntmen changed positions , and the image was later reversed .\n  choice: Ronnie Rondell\n  choice: Benny Hinn\nAnswer:","targets":["Benny Hinn"],"multiple_choice_targets":["Benny Hinn","Ronnie Rondell"],"multiple_choice_scores":[1,0],"idx":2352,"is_generated":false,"true_idx":2352},{"inputs":"What is the answer to the question, assuming the context is true.\n\n\nQuestion: who plays papi jr in beverly hills chihuahua 2?\nContext: Bob Newhart as Papi Jr .\n  choice: Zachary Gordon\n  choice: Bob Newhart\nAnswer:","targets":["Bob Newhart"],"multiple_choice_targets":["Bob Newhart","Zachary Gordon"],"multiple_choice_scores":[1,0],"idx":2940,"is_generated":false,"true_idx":2940},{"inputs":"What is the answer to the question, assuming the context is true.\n\n\nQuestion: who sang i just wan na make love to you?\nContext: `` I Just Want to Make Love to You '' is a 1954 blues song written by Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi , first recorded by Muddy Waters , and released as `` Just Make Love to Me '' ( Chess 1571 ) .

High school , college and most professional football leagues offer only a three - point field goal ; however , some professional leagues have encouraged more rare kicks through four - point field goals . NFL Europe encouraged long field goals of 50 yards or more by making those worth four points instead of three ( much like Australian rules ' Super Goal or basketball 's three - point line ) , a rule since adopted by the Stars Football League . Similarly , the sport of arena football sought ( unsuccessfully ) to repopularize the drop kick by making that worth four points ; it failed , since only one kicker ( Brian Mitchell ) was able to do it with any semblance of proficiency .
