Webb jumped in and defended von Braun, until Kennedy ended the squabble by stating that the matter was \"still subject to final review\". Webb held firm, and issued a request for proposal to candidate Lunar Excursion Module (LEM) contractors. Wiesner finally relented, unwilling to settle the dispute once and for all in Kennedy's office, because of the President's involvement with the October Cuban missile crisis, and fear of Kennedy's support for Webb.

Philip solicited the approval of Luther, Melanchthon, and Bucer, citing as a precedent the polygamy of the patriarchs. The theologians were not prepared to make a general ruling, and they reluctantly advised the landgrave that if he was determined, he should marry secretly and keep quiet about the matter. As a result, on 4 March 1540, Philip married a second wife, Margarethe von der Saale, with Melanchthon and Bucer among the witnesses. However, Philip was unable to keep the marriage secret, and he threatened to make Luther's advice public. Luther told him to \"tell a good, strong lie\" and deny the marriage completely, which Philip did during the subsequent public controversy. In the view of Luther's biographer Martin Brecht, \"giving confessional advice for Philip of Hesse was one of the worst mistakes Luther made, and, next to the landgrave himself, who was directly responsible for it, history chiefly holds Luther accountable\". Brecht argues that Luther's mistake was not that he gave private pastoral advice, but that he miscalculated the political implications.

Although many plants and factories can be found along the Rhine up into Switzerland, it is along the Lower Rhine that the bulk of them are concentrated, as the river passes the major cities of Cologne, D\u00fcsseldorf and Duisburg. Duisburg is the home of Europe's largest inland port and functions as a hub to the sea ports of Rotterdam, Antwerp and Amsterdam. The Ruhr, which joins the Rhine in Duisburg, is nowadays a clean river, thanks to a combination of stricter environmental controls, a transition from heavy industry to light industry and cleanup measures, such as the reforestation of Slag and brownfields. The Ruhr currently provides the region with drinking water. It contributes 70 m3\/s (2,500 cu ft\/s) to the Rhine.

It originates from medicine and early studies on the causes of immunity to disease. The earliest known reference to immunity was during the plague of Athens in 430 BC. Thucydides noted that people who had recovered from a previous bout of the disease could nurse the sick without contracting the illness a second time. In the 18th century, Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis made experiments with scorpion venom and observed that certain dogs and mice were immune to this venom. This and other observations of acquired immunity were later exploited by Louis Pasteur in his development of vaccination and his proposed germ theory of disease. Pasteur's theory was in direct opposition to contemporary theories of disease, such as the miasma theory. It was not until Robert Koch's 1891 proofs, for which he was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1905, that microorganisms were confirmed as the cause of infectious disease. Viruses were confirmed as human pathogens in 1901, with the discovery of the yellow fever virus by Walter Reed.\n  choice: In 1905, who was awarded the nobel prize?\n  choice: Who coined the term \"germ theory\"?\n  choice: Who was the first to discover the yellow fever virus?\nChoose the appropriate question which has the given answer.","targets":["Who was the first to discover the yellow fever virus?"],"multiple_choice_targets":["Who was the first to discover the yellow fever virus?","Who coined the term \"germ theory\"?","In 1905, who was awarded the nobel prize?"],"multiple_choice_scores":[1,0,0],"idx":123,"is_generated":false,"true_idx":123},{"inputs":"Given a short answer along with its context, select the most appropriate question which has the given short answer as its answer.\n\nHere is the short answer followed by the context.\nShort Answer: Committee of Independent Experts Context: Commissioners have various privileges, such as being exempt from member state taxes (but not EU taxes), and having immunity from prosecution for doing official acts. Commissioners have sometimes been found to have abused their offices, particularly since the Santer Commission was censured by Parliament in 1999, and it eventually resigned due to corruption allegations. This resulted in one main case, Commission v Edith Cresson where the European Court of Justice held that a Commissioner giving her dentist a job, for which he was clearly unqualified, did in fact not break any law. By contrast to the ECJ's relaxed approach, a Committee of Independent Experts found that a culture had developed where few Commissioners had \u2018even the slightest sense of responsibility\u2019. This led to the creation of the European Anti-fraud Office. In 2012 it investigated the Maltese Commissioner for Health, John Dalli, who quickly resigned after allegations that he received a \u20ac60m bribe in connection with a Tobacco Products Directive. Beyond the Commission, the European Central Bank has relative executive autonomy in its conduct of monetary policy for the purpose of managing the euro. It has a six-person board appointed by the European Council, on the Council's recommendation.

This has meant both the European Court of Justice and the highest national courts have had to develop principles to resolve conflicts of laws between different systems. Within the EU itself, the Court of Justice's view is that if EU law conflicts with a provision of national law, then EU law has primacy. In the first major case in 1964, Costa v ENEL, a Milanese lawyer, and former shareholder of an energy company, named Mr Costa refused to pay his electricity bill to Enel, as a protest against the nationalisation of the Italian energy corporations. He claimed the Italian nationalisation law conflicted with the Treaty of Rome, and requested a reference be made to both the Italian Constitutional Court and the Court of Justice under TFEU article 267. The Italian Constitutional Court gave an opinion that because the nationalisation law was from 1962, and the treaty was in force from 1958, Costa had no claim. By contrast, the Court of Justice held that ultimately the Treaty of Rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation, and in any case under the Treaty provisions only the Commission could have brought a claim, not Mr Costa. However, in principle, Mr Costa was entitled to plead that the Treaty conflicted with national law, and the court would have a duty to consider his claim to make a reference if there would be no appeal against its decision. The Court of Justice, repeating its view in Van Gend en Loos, said member states \"albeit within limited spheres, have restricted their sovereign rights and created a body of law applicable both to their nationals and to themselves\" on the \"basis of reciprocity\". EU law would not \"be overridden by domestic legal provisions, however framed... without the legal basis of the community itself being called into question.\" This meant any \"subsequent unilateral act\" of the member state inapplicable. Similarly, in Amministrazione delle Finanze v Simmenthal SpA, a company, Simmenthal SpA, claimed that a public health inspection fee under an Italian law of 1970 for importing beef from France to Italy was contrary to two Regulations from 1964 and 1968. In \"accordance with the principle of the precedence of Community law,\" said the Court of Justice, the \"directly applicable measures of the institutions\" (such as the Regulations in the case) \"render automatically inapplicable any conflicting provision of current national law\". This was necessary to prevent a \"corresponding denial\" of Treaty \"obligations undertaken unconditionally and irrevocably by member states\", that could \"imperil the very foundations of the\" EU. But despite the views of the Court of Justice, the national courts of member states have not accepted the same analysis.\n  choice: Which court ruled that energy nationalism was not prohibited by the treaty of rome?\n  choice: Which bodies have had to establish standards for resolving conflicts between laws from various systems?\nChoose the appropriate question which has the given answer.","targets":["Which bodies have had to establish standards for resolving conflicts between laws from various systems?"],"multiple_choice_targets":["Which bodies have had to establish standards for resolving conflicts between laws from various systems?","Which court ruled that energy nationalism was not prohibited by the treaty of rome?"],"multiple_choice_scores":[1,0],"idx":423,"is_generated":false,"true_idx":423},{"inputs":"Given a short answer along with its context, select the most appropriate question which has the given short answer as its answer.\n\nHere is the short answer followed by the context.\nShort Answer: Greg Olsen Context: The Panthers offense, which led the NFL in scoring (500 points), was loaded with talent, boasting six Pro Bowl selections.

Other arguments include the lack of accounts of the death of rats before outbreaks of plague between the 14th and 17th centuries; temperatures that are too cold in northern Europe for the survival of fleas; that, despite primitive transport systems, the spread of the Black Death was much faster than that of modern bubonic plague; that mortality rates of the Black Death appear to be very high; that, while modern bubonic plague is largely endemic as a rural disease, the Black Death indiscriminately struck urban and rural areas; and that the pattern of the Black Death, with major outbreaks in the same areas separated by 5 to 15 years, differs from modern bubonic plague\u2014which often becomes endemic for decades with annual flare-ups.\n  choice: Why would the temperature have an effect on the theory of plague transmission?\n  choice: Why do you think rats aren't to blame for the plague?\nChoose the appropriate question which has the given answer.","targets":["Why do you think rats aren't to blame for the plague?"],"multiple_choice_targets":["Why do you think rats aren't to blame for the plague?","Why would the temperature have an effect on the theory of plague transmission?"],"multiple_choice_scores":[1,0],"idx":899,"is_generated":false,"true_idx":899},{"inputs":"Given a short answer along with its context, select the most appropriate question which has the given short answer as its answer.\n\nHere is the short answer followed by the context.\nShort Answer: 232 Context: The television network has eight owned-and-operated and over 232 affiliated television stations throughout the United States and its territories.

Due to its central location between the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth's capitals of Krak\u00f3w and Vilnius, Warsaw became the capital of the Commonwealth and of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland when King Sigismund III Vasa moved his court from Krak\u00f3w to Warsaw in 1596. After the Third Partition of Poland in 1795, Warsaw was incorporated into the Kingdom of Prussia. In 1806 during the Napoleonic Wars, the city became the official capital of the Grand Duchy of Warsaw, a puppet state of the First French Empire established by Napoleon Bonaparte. In accordance with the decisions of the Congress of Vienna, the Russian Empire annexed Warsaw in 1815 and it became part of the \"Congress Kingdom\". Only in 1918 did it regain independence from the foreign rule and emerge as a new capital of the independent Republic of Poland. The German invasion in 1939, the massacre of the Jewish population and deportations to concentration camps led to the uprising in the Warsaw ghetto in 1943 and to the major and devastating Warsaw Uprising between August and October 1944. Warsaw gained the title of the \"Phoenix City\" because it has survived many wars, conflicts and invasions throughout its long history. Most notably, the city required painstaking rebuilding after the extensive damage it suffered in World War II, which destroyed 85% of its buildings. On 9 November 1940, the city was awarded Poland's highest military decoration for heroism, the Virtuti Militari, during the Siege of Warsaw (1939).\n  choice: When was the first time warsaw was mentioned in history?\n  choice: When did warsaw become the polish kingdom's capital?\nChoose the appropriate question which has the given answer.","targets":["When was the first time warsaw was mentioned in history?"],"multiple_choice_targets":["When was the first time warsaw was mentioned in history?","When did warsaw become the polish kingdom's capital?"],"multiple_choice_scores":[1,0],"idx":364,"is_generated":false,"true_idx":364},{"inputs":"Given a short answer along with its context, select the most appropriate question which has the given short answer as its answer.\n\nHere is the short answer followed by the context.\nShort Answer: Diepoldsau Context: A regulation of the Rhine was called for, with an upper canal near Diepoldsau and a lower canal at Fu\u00dfach, in order to counteract the constant flooding and strong sedimentation in the western Rhine Delta.

The Black Death ravaged Europe for three years before it continued on into Russia, where the disease was present somewhere in the country 25 times between 1350 to 1490. Plague epidemics ravaged London in 1563, 1593, 1603, 1625, 1636, and 1665, reducing its population by 10 to 30% during those years. Over 10% of Amsterdam's population died in 1623\u201325, and again in 1635\u201336, 1655, and 1664. Plague occurred in Venice 22 times between 1361 and 1528. The plague of 1576\u201377 killed 50,000 in Venice, almost a third of the population. Late outbreaks in central Europe included the Italian Plague of 1629\u20131631, which is associated with troop movements during the Thirty Years' War, and the Great Plague of Vienna in 1679.

The university has an artist-in-residence program and scholars in performance studies, contemporary art criticism, and film history. It has offered a doctorate in music composition since 1933 and in Cinema & Media studies since 2000, a master of fine arts in visual arts (early 1970s), and a master of arts in the humanities with a creative writing track (2000). It has bachelor's degree programs in visual arts, music, and art history, and, more recently, Cinema & Media studies (1996) and theater & performance studies (2002). The College's general education core includes a \u201cdramatic, music, and visual arts\u201d requirement, requiring students to study the history of the arts, stage desire, or begin working with sculpture. Several thousand major and non-major undergraduates enroll annually in creative and performing arts classes. UChicago is often considered the birthplace of improvisational comedy as the Compass Players student comedy troupe evolved into The Second City improv theater troupe in 1959. The Reva and David Logan Center for the Arts opened in October 2012, five years after a $35 million gift from alumnus David Logan and his wife Reva. The center includes spaces for exhibitions, performances, classes, and media production. The Logan Center was designed by Tod Williams and Billie Tsien. This building is actually entirely glass.

There is much debate on this point, as some believe that it is a civil disobedient's duty to submit to the punishment prescribed by law, while others believe that defending oneself in court will increase the possibility of changing the unjust law. It has also been argued that either choice is compatible with the spirit of civil disobedience. ACT-UP's Civil Disobedience Training handbook states that a civil disobedient who pleads guilty is essentially stating, \"Yes, I committed the act of which you accuse me. I don't deny it; in fact, I am proud of it. I feel I did the right thing by violating this particular law; I am guilty as charged,\" but that pleading not guilty sends a message of, \"Guilt implies wrong-doing. I feel I have done no wrong. I may have violated some specific laws, but I am guilty of doing no wrong. I therefore plead not guilty.\" A plea of no contest is sometimes regarded as a compromise between the two.

The logo also deviates from the template by featuring large numerals, colored in gold, behind the Vince Lombardi Trophy, instead of underneath and in silver as in the standard logo.\n  choice: When did the nfl declare that the super bowl number will no longer be assigned using roman numerals?\n  choice: When did the nfl reveal that roman numerals will no longer be used to brand the super bowl?\n  choice: When will roman numerals be used to indicate the super bowl number once more?\nChoose the appropriate question which has the given answer.","targets":["When will roman numerals be used to indicate the super bowl number once more?"],"multiple_choice_targets":["When will roman numerals be used to indicate the super bowl number once more?","When did the nfl reveal that roman numerals will no longer be used to brand the super bowl?","When did the nfl declare that the super bowl number will no longer be assigned using roman numerals?"],"multiple_choice_scores":[1,0,0],"idx":494,"is_generated":false,"true_idx":494},{"inputs":"Given a short answer along with its context, select the most appropriate question which has the given short answer as its answer.\n\nHere is the short answer followed by the context.\nShort Answer: Europe Context: The Rhine (Romansh: Rein, German: Rhein, French: le Rhin, Dutch: Rijn) is a European river that begins in the Swiss canton of Graub\u00fcnden in the southeastern Swiss Alps, forms part of the Swiss-Austrian, Swiss-Liechtenstein border, Swiss-German and then the Franco-German border, then flows through the Rhineland and eventually empties into the North Sea in the Netherlands. The biggest city on the river Rhine is Cologne, Germany with a population of more than 1,050,000 people. It is the second-longest river in Central and Western Europe (after the Danube), at about 1,230 km (760 mi),[note 2][note 1] with an average discharge of about 2,900 m3\/s (100,000 cu ft\/s).\n  choice: What happened to the rhine?\n  choice: What is the location of the rhine's apex?\n  choice: What is the starting point for the rhine?\nChoose the appropriate question which has the given answer.","targets":["What happened to the rhine?"],"multiple_choice_targets":["What happened to the rhine?","What is the starting point for the rhine?","What is the location of the rhine's apex?"],"multiple_choice_scores":[1,0,0],"idx":1174,"is_generated":false,"true_idx":1174},{"inputs":"Given a short answer along with its context, select the most appropriate question which has the given short answer as its answer.\n\nHere is the short answer followed by the context.\nShort Answer: Henry Moore and Jacob Epstein Context: With the opening of the Dorothy and Michael Hintze sculpture galleries in 2006 it was decided to extend the chronology of the works on display up to 1950; this has involved loans by other museums, including Tate Britain, so works by Henry Moore and Jacob Epstein along with other of their contemporaries are now on view. These galleries concentrate on works dated 1600 to 1950 by British sculptors, works by continental sculptors who worked in Britain, and works bought by British patrons from the continental sculptors, such as Canova's Theseus and the Minotaur. The galleries overlooking the garden are arranged by theme, tomb sculpture, portraiture, garden sculpture and mythology. Then there is a section that covers late 19th-century and early 20th-century sculpture, this includes work by Rodin and other French sculptors such as Dalou who spent several years in Britain where he taught sculpture.\n  choice: With the opening of the new galleries, which two british sculptors are now represented?\n  choice: Which museum was one of the first to lend more contemporary works to the new sculpture galleries?\nChoose the appropriate question which has the given answer.","targets":["With the opening of the new galleries, which two british sculptors are now represented?"],"multiple_choice_targets":["With the opening of the new galleries, which two british sculptors are now represented?","Which museum was one of the first to lend more contemporary works to the new sculpture galleries?"],"multiple_choice_scores":[1,0],"idx":782,"is_generated":false,"true_idx":782},{"inputs":"Given a short answer along with its context, select the most appropriate question which has the given short answer as its answer.\n\nHere is the short answer followed by the context.\nShort Answer: 149,025 Context: As of the census of 2000, there were 427,652 people, 140,079 households, and 97,915 families residing in the city.

An architect normally manages the job, and a construction manager, design engineer, construction engineer or project manager supervises it. For the successful execution of a project, effective planning is essential. Those involved with the design and execution of the infrastructure in question must consider zoning requirements, the environmental impact of the job, the successful scheduling, budgeting, construction-site safety, availability and transportation of building materials, logistics, inconvenience to the public caused by construction delays and bidding, etc. The largest construction projects are referred to as megaprojects.\n  choice: Who usually oversees a building project?\n  choice: In most cases, who is in charge of a building project?\nChoose the appropriate question which has the given answer.","targets":["In most cases, who is in charge of a building project?"],"multiple_choice_targets":["In most cases, who is in charge of a building project?","Who usually oversees a building project?"],"multiple_choice_scores":[1,0],"idx":564,"is_generated":false,"true_idx":564},{"inputs":"Given a short answer along with its context, select the most appropriate question which has the given short answer as its answer.\n\nHere is the short answer followed by the context.\nShort Answer: 1996 Context: The UChicago Arts program joins academic departments and programs in the Division of the Humanities and the College, as well as professional organizations including the Court Theatre, the Oriental Institute, the Smart Museum of Art, the Renaissance Society, University of Chicago Presents, and student arts organizations. The university has an artist-in-residence program and scholars in performance studies, contemporary art criticism, and film history. It has offered a doctorate in music composition since 1933 and in Cinema & Media studies since 2000, a master of fine arts in visual arts (early 1970s), and a master of arts in the humanities with a creative writing track (2000). It has bachelor's degree programs in visual arts, music, and art history, and, more recently, Cinema & Media studies (1996) and theater & performance studies (2002). The College's general education core includes a \u201cdramatic, music, and visual arts\u201d requirement, requiring students to study the history of the arts, stage desire, or begin working with sculpture. Several thousand major and non-major undergraduates enroll annually in creative and performing arts classes. UChicago is often considered the birthplace of improvisational comedy as the Compass Players student comedy troupe evolved into The Second City improv theater troupe in 1959. The Reva and David Logan Center for the Arts opened in October 2012, five years after a $35 million gift from alumnus David Logan and his wife Reva. The center includes spaces for exhibitions, performances, classes, and media production. The Logan Center was designed by Tod Williams and Billie Tsien. This building is actually entirely glass. The brick is a facade designed to keep the glass safe from the wind. The architects later removed sections of the bricks when pressure arose in the form of complaints that the views of the city were blocked.\n  choice: When did the university start offering a theater and performance studies bachelor's degree program?\n  choice: When did the university start offering a cinema & media studies bachelor's degree program?\nChoose the appropriate question which has the given answer.","targets":["When did the university start offering a cinema & media studies bachelor's degree program?"],"multiple_choice_targets":["When did the university start offering a cinema & media studies bachelor's degree program?","When did the university start offering a theater and performance studies bachelor's degree program?"],"multiple_choice_scores":[1,0],"idx":391,"is_generated":false,"true_idx":391},{"inputs":"Given a short answer along with its context, select the most appropriate question which has the given short answer as its answer.\n\nHere is the short answer followed by the context.\nShort Answer: Richard Leakey Context: Fossils found in Kenya suggest that primates roamed the area more than 20 million years ago. Recent findings near Lake Turkana indicate that hominids such as Homo habilis (1.8 and 2.5 million years ago) and Homo erectus (1.8 million to 350,000 years ago) are possible direct ancestors of modern Homo sapiens, and lived in Kenya in the Pleistocene epoch. During excavations at Lake Turkana in 1984, paleoanthropologist Richard Leakey assisted by Kamoya Kimeu discovered the Turkana Boy, a 1.6-million-year-old fossil belonging to Homo erectus. Previous research on early hominids is particularly identified with Mary Leakey and Louis Leakey, who were responsible for the preliminary archaeological research at Olorgesailie and Hyrax Hill.
