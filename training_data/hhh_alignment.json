Can you summarize it for me in a few steps?\n\n\"Painting porch or deck rails may be a bit more laborious than painting a wall, but it doesn't have to be back-breaking work. Paint wood railings the easy way instead. Clean and prep the area ahead of time, then keep all your painting supplies within reach, including a number of different painting tools for speedy paint application.\n\nPre-Painting Preparation\nWhether relatively new or decades old, those railings must be clean, dry and smooth before applying a porch or deck railing paint. For any wood railings that aren't freshly installed, wipe them down with a tack cloth if they're relatively clean or a slightly damp rag. If the railings are really dirty, remove as much dust as possible, otherwise the paint won't adhere well.\n\nOnce the railings are dry, sand rough spots with fine-grit sandpaper. Go over the railings with your hand while wearing a garden glove to find potential splinters or snags, then sand those away. Wipe the railings with a tack cloth again.\n\nApply painter's tape around the bottom edges of the posts, then cover the area beneath and around the railings with a drop cloth or sheets of newspaper, taping down the edges of the paper to keep the sheets from blowing away. Use tape to cover all nearby areas that you wish to protect from paint, such as the surrounding wall area where walls and railings meet.\n\nThe Best Paint for Porch Railings\nThere is no single brand or type of paint that is the absolute best for porch and deck railings, but a few options help ensure success. Both latex or oil-based exterior primers and paints hold up well on wood railings. Exterior paints are designed to hold up to the elements. They also block ultraviolet rays, which could otherwise cause paint to fade prematurely.\n\nChoose compatible paints and primers when selecting your supplies for painting. An all-in-one exterior paint and primer also works well.\n\nEasy Way to Paint Railings\nWhen it comes to painting porch or deck railings, the vertical spindles are the most difficult part because they're often narrow and plentiful. Prime and paint these first, so you'll still be able to touch the handrail as you lean over and work. Tools that help make the spindle-painting process easier include a 1-inch-wide paintbrush, a painter's mitt and a miniature paint roller.\n\nTry out each of these tools as you apply primer to see which you prefer. A mitt allows you to work quickly, as well as easily reach around the spindles. A paintbrush, on the other hand, works well for both straight and curved surfaces. A mini roller is fast, but easier to manage on flat surfaces.\n\nAfter you've primed the spindles, paint the posts, horizontal braces and railings using either a paint roller or a wider brush. The ideal brush or roller is wide enough to span the narrowest part of the project piece. Once the primer is dry all over, apply paint to spindles first, then posts and rails.\n\nPainting Metal Railings\nAs with wood porch or deck rails, metal railings require a bit of preparation before painting. Clean them, sand away any rust, clean them again, then wipe them down with a tack cloth. Mask off areas you wish to protect, which can include covering nearby shrubs with drop cloths or old sheets. Apply a rust-blocking primer to the metal, then go over it again with a compatible metal spray paint designed for durability.\"\nAssistant:","targets":["1. Pre-Painting Preparation\n2.

Can you summarize it for me in a few steps?\n\n\"Painting porch or deck rails may be a bit more laborious than painting a wall, but it doesn't have to be back-breaking work. Paint wood railings the easy way instead. Clean and prep the area ahead of time, then keep all your painting supplies within reach, including a number of different painting tools for speedy paint application.\n\nPre-Painting Preparation\nWhether relatively new or decades old, those railings must be clean, dry and smooth before applying a porch or deck railing paint. For any wood railings that aren't freshly installed, wipe them down with a tack cloth if they're relatively clean or a slightly damp rag. If the railings are really dirty, remove as much dust as possible, otherwise the paint won't adhere well.\n\nOnce the railings are dry, sand rough spots with fine-grit sandpaper. Go over the railings with your hand while wearing a garden glove to find potential splinters or snags, then sand those away. Wipe the railings with a tack cloth again.\n\nApply painter's tape around the bottom edges of the posts, then cover the area beneath and around the railings with a drop cloth or sheets of newspaper, taping down the edges of the paper to keep the sheets from blowing away. Use tape to cover all nearby areas that you wish to protect from paint, such as the surrounding wall area where walls and railings meet.\n\nThe Best Paint for Porch Railings\nThere is no single brand or type of paint that is the absolute best for porch and deck railings, but a few options help ensure success. Both latex or oil-based exterior primers and paints hold up well on wood railings. Exterior paints are designed to hold up to the elements. They also block ultraviolet rays, which could otherwise cause paint to fade prematurely.\n\nChoose compatible paints and primers when selecting your supplies for painting. An all-in-one exterior paint and primer also works well.\n\nEasy Way to Paint Railings\nWhen it comes to painting porch or deck railings, the vertical spindles are the most difficult part because they're often narrow and plentiful. Prime and paint these first, so you'll still be able to touch the handrail as you lean over and work. Tools that help make the spindle-painting process easier include a 1-inch-wide paintbrush, a painter's mitt and a miniature paint roller.\n\nTry out each of these tools as you apply primer to see which you prefer. A mitt allows you to work quickly, as well as easily reach around the spindles. A paintbrush, on the other hand, works well for both straight and curved surfaces. A mini roller is fast, but easier to manage on flat surfaces.\n\nAfter you've primed the spindles, paint the posts, horizontal braces and railings using either a paint roller or a wider brush. The ideal brush or roller is wide enough to span the narrowest part of the project piece. Once the primer is dry all over, apply paint to spindles first, then posts and rails.\n\nPainting Metal Railings\nAs with wood porch or deck rails, metal railings require a bit of preparation before painting. Clean them, sand away any rust, clean them again, then wipe them down with a tack cloth. Mask off areas you wish to protect, which can include covering nearby shrubs with drop cloths or old sheets. Apply a rust-blocking primer to the metal, then go over it again with a compatible metal spray paint designed for durability.\"\nAssistant:","targets":["1. Pre-Painting Preparation\n2.

In today\u2019s dollars it would have cost $500 million dollars, more than any bridge built since!  \n\nJoseph Strauss headed the project.  He innovated the use of movable safety netting beneath the construction site, which saved the lives of many otherwise-unprotected ironworkers. Of eleven men killed from falls during the three-year construction period, ten were killed on a single day, when the bridge was near completion and the net failed under the stress of a scaffold that had fallen.  Nineteen others who were saved by the net over the course of construction became members of the \u201cStraight Outta Hell\u201d Club.  Strauss also included a brick from his alma mater, the University of Cincinnati, within the structure of the bridge to pay homage to the contributions of the working man and the importance of education and progress.\n\nInterestingly though, a relatively unknown residential architect named Ellen Morrow designed the overall shape of the bridge towers, the lighting scheme, and tower decorations, streetlights, railings, and walkways. The famous color was her personal selection, winning out over other possibilities, including the US Navy's suggestion that it be painted with black and yellow stripes to ensure visibility by passing ships.  \n\nFortunately, the project head Strauss was an extremely generous collaborator, and he gave credit -- some say too much credit -- to others for their work on the project.  So designers and engineers like Leon Moisseiff, Charles Alton Ellis, and Ellen Morrow are now world-famous for their part in building the most beautiful bridge ever built by the hand of man.  Strauss also frequently encouraged San Franciscans to applaud the work of the laborers who actually made the bridge possible.\n\nAssistant:  Some of it seems reasonable, but I think the comparisons to the cost of other bridges, and some of the comments on Strauss aren\u2019t correct.

Can you summarize it for me in a few steps?\n\n\"Painting porch or deck rails may be a bit more laborious than painting a wall, but it doesn't have to be back-breaking work. Paint wood railings the easy way instead. Clean and prep the area ahead of time, then keep all your painting supplies within reach, including a number of different painting tools for speedy paint application.\n\nPre-Painting Preparation\nWhether relatively new or decades old, those railings must be clean, dry and smooth before applying a porch or deck railing paint. For any wood railings that aren't freshly installed, wipe them down with a tack cloth if they're relatively clean or a slightly damp rag. If the railings are really dirty, remove as much dust as possible, otherwise the paint won't adhere well.\n\nOnce the railings are dry, sand rough spots with fine-grit sandpaper. Go over the railings with your hand while wearing a garden glove to find potential splinters or snags, then sand those away. Wipe the railings with a tack cloth again.\n\nApply painter's tape around the bottom edges of the posts, then cover the area beneath and around the railings with a drop cloth or sheets of newspaper, taping down the edges of the paper to keep the sheets from blowing away. Use tape to cover all nearby areas that you wish to protect from paint, such as the surrounding wall area where walls and railings meet.\n\nThe Best Paint for Porch Railings\nThere is no single brand or type of paint that is the absolute best for porch and deck railings, but a few options help ensure success. Both latex or oil-based exterior primers and paints hold up well on wood railings. Exterior paints are designed to hold up to the elements. They also block ultraviolet rays, which could otherwise cause paint to fade prematurely.\n\nChoose compatible paints and primers when selecting your supplies for painting. An all-in-one exterior paint and primer also works well.\n\nEasy Way to Paint Railings\nWhen it comes to painting porch or deck railings, the vertical spindles are the most difficult part because they're often narrow and plentiful. Prime and paint these first, so you'll still be able to touch the handrail as you lean over and work. Tools that help make the spindle-painting process easier include a 1-inch-wide paintbrush, a painter's mitt and a miniature paint roller.\n\nTry out each of these tools as you apply primer to see which you prefer. A mitt allows you to work quickly, as well as easily reach around the spindles. A paintbrush, on the other hand, works well for both straight and curved surfaces. A mini roller is fast, but easier to manage on flat surfaces.\n\nAfter you've primed the spindles, paint the posts, horizontal braces and railings using either a paint roller or a wider brush. The ideal brush or roller is wide enough to span the narrowest part of the project piece. Once the primer is dry all over, apply paint to spindles first, then posts and rails.\n\nPainting Metal Railings\nAs with wood porch or deck rails, metal railings require a bit of preparation before painting. Clean them, sand away any rust, clean them again, then wipe them down with a tack cloth. Mask off areas you wish to protect, which can include covering nearby shrubs with drop cloths or old sheets. Apply a rust-blocking primer to the metal, then go over it again with a compatible metal spray paint designed for durability.\"\nAssistant:","targets":["1.
