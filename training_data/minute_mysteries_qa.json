{"inputs":"Story: When Martin Caldwell got to his office on Monday morning, he felt as if he had just left minutes ago. Being a city detective called for long and sometimes boring investigations that often led nowhere. He had only had four hours of sleep and when he looked in the mirror in the men's room, he could tell it. With the bags under his eyes along with the weight he had gained he looked like a basset hound. What hair he had left was sprinkled with gray and his blue eyes were so red that they looked like a Florida road map. Along with his rumpled suit he had spilled coffee and mustard on his white shirt, but he couldn't seem to make himself care. \"Maybe nothing will happen today and I can steal a short nap,\u201d he thought. He had closed the door and settled back in his chair with his feet on the desk when the phone began ringing. He let it trill on a few times hoping it would stop, but knowing it wouldn't. \"Detective Caldwell, I'm glad you finally made it to work this morning, and just in time too, there's been a bank robbery\" the deep voice said. Martin recognized the voice of Chief Jennings and started to protest, but having been on this earth for fifty-one years and knowing the chief, said only, \"where and when?\u201d The chief told him that Macon Central Savings had been robbed only thirty minutes ago, about 9:47 a.m. He was to go and interview the witnesses and talk to the security guard about the heist. \"Maybe this will be quick and I can go home,\u201d he thought. The bank was fairly new, having been built only two years ago in 1974 and he knew it well because he had a small retirement account there. Thus he was acquainted with the personnel and the bank president, Mr. Riley. When he entered, Mrs. Parker was sitting in one of the chairs along the wall and was being consoled by a pretty young Oriental girl that Martin recognized as a recently hired teller. In her sixty's and spry as ever, Mrs. Parker seemed relieved to see the detective and began telling what happened. \"I was alone up front behind the tellers counter when the thief suddenly burst in without saying a word and handed me a note, saying to put all of the money in the bag that he was carrying.\" Martin lifted his head and asked, \"did you say he?\u201d Mrs. Parker smiled and answered, \"well, I'm not sure of course, because the thief didn't say a word and was wearing a hood and gloves that concealed his features. He just handed me the note and brandished a pistol at me, so I stuffed all of the money in the bag and then the robber ran out the door.\u201d Martin also discovered that the security video wasn't operating and was being replaced by a newer system. Having gleaned everything of importance from Mrs. Parker, including the description of medium height and weight, a description that would fit a lot of people, he went looking for the security guard, a guy named Bill Thomas. Bill, who used to work at police headquarters but retired and now worked part time at the bank, was coming out of the bank president\u2019s office and saw that Martin had arrived. \"Hey Bill, let me guess, you were in the john and didn't see anything, right?\u201d Martin and Bill were old friends and had shared many cases together so they knew each other well. \"Aw, come on Martin, you know my routine so well that you already knew that. But I did get out in time to see the car speeding away and it was a 1976 Porsche 911, burgundy in color. I've never seen one that color before but that's what it was. My nephew has a 911 and I couldn't be mistaken.\u201d Martin told Bill that he would talk to him later and went to use the phone. When Martin called the Department of Motor vehicles, he found out that there were only five 911's in the whole country that matched that description. All of them sold in Macon at the local dealership. When someone made a special order for the burgundy color a mistake was made and five were shipped and sold in 1976. The only difference in them was that one had an automatic transmissions and the others all had manual shifters which entailed using a clutch. Bill hadn't noticed the difference so Martin got the phone numbers of the owners and asked them to come down to the bank. He hoped that one of them wouldn't show up and maybe narrow the field, but they all agreed to come. Frankie Cole was the first to arrive because he worked at the nearby airport and just had a short commute. He was working in one of the back hangars as a mechanic but he was working alone and didn't have an alibi. His car was shiny and clean with a manual shifter and purred like a kitten when running. He seemed like an honest guy, but in this business you never knew. He was the right size but so far that didn't mean anything Amy Golden, a housewife and mother pulled in beside Frankie and shut off her motor. Her car also had a manual shifter and was identical except for a small faded decal in the rear window. She too seemed very pleasant. Again, the size matched. Although they were not with her at the time of the robbery, her aunt and uncle would vouch for her character she said and gave Martin their phone number. The third to arrive was Susan Barker who worked for Dr. Pitts down the road. She was indignant about having to leave her job to be interviewed and swore that she was working when the bank was robbed. She was a little larger in build than the other two but not much. Again, she had an identical car. Like the first two cars, the shifter had the H pattern on it with the numbers one through four and a reverse to the side. Jeremy Steele, a pimpled-faced young man was angry to have to come over for questioning. His girlfriend, a plump young blond named Tammy, drove him to the bank. When asked why Tammy drove him in, Jeremy pointed to the signature-covered cast on his left foot and said that he could not work the clutch with his broken foot. Unfortunately, Tammy was not able to vouch for his whereabouts at the time of the robbery. The last suspect to arrive was a young black college student named Lionel Jackson, who was on the way to school and didn't have a solid alibi either. His car was in perfect shape like the others. Very polite and, you guessed it, medium build and weight. Martin sat in the car and looked at the familiar PRNDL that was short for park, reverse, neutral, drive and low gears. Nothing was ever easy it seemed in these cases. Shaking his head, Martin walked back over to Bill and asked him what view he had of the car while it was racing away. \" I was running up behind it when the thief cranked up and sped off. But I'm sure that it didn't have anything on the rear window.\u201d Martin trusted Bill's eyewitness account because of Bill's police training. \" Martin looked at the empty parking space behind the bank president's car and asked, \"did the thief put the car in reverse before leaving the parking space, or just go straight ahead?\" Bill frowned and thought for a moment before answering, \"nope, not a flicker of the back up lights, so no, no reverse.\u201d After thinking about all of the testimonies of the suspects he said to Bill. \"Do you still have your old set of rusty handcuffs, I left mine at the station?\u201d Bill smiled and said, \" So you know who did it huh?\u201d Martin said. \"Sometimes you get lucky.\" Who is the thief?\n  choice: Frankie Cole\n  choice: Susan Barker\n  choice: Jeremy Steele\n  choice: Amy Golden\n  choice: Lionel Jacobs\nAnswer:","targets":["Frankie Cole"],"multiple_choice_targets":["Amy Golden","Frankie Cole","Jeremy Steele","Lionel Jacobs","Susan Barker"],"multiple_choice_scores":[0,1,0,0,0],"idx":75}
{"inputs":"Story: Tim, the led investigator of the crash looks over the recovered wreckage. There is hardly anything to lead him to a conclusion. All the bodies show no sign of injuries and there are bones that were broken after the plane hit the water. Valerie, one of his colleagues is analysing a chunk of the door. It is charred at the edges and there is a shaving razor imbedded in to it. 'Tim, look at this. The razor should have broken but it is intact. The comb belongs to a flight attendant because no one else was sitting near enough to the door', Valerie says. I step away from the table and approach Tim and Valerie to study the evidence. It is one of the most intriguing pieces of wreckage that we recovered. No one knows why or how the razor was able to be imbedded. The force of the impact would have shattered it. 'Where was the chunk of door found?' I say nervously. I was new here and I didn't want to make myself look like I was inexperienced (although I was). I spoke as little as possible and would not touch the evidence when absolutely necessary. 'Very close to land. Only half a kilometre away'. Valerie replied. Tim wouldn't speak to me. He's never been happy when a new person comes in Valerie told me. That night, after watching Tim lock up the warehouse securely to stop intruders, I started to do some of my own work as to what happened to that mysterious section of door. Working from photographs I had secretly taken earlier, I noticed that there was some text on the white and cleaner side. After orientating the evidence, I found that the scorch marks were coming from above. There had been a fire on the ceiling. The next day, I was working with a new group of investigators. Emma, Mary and Peter. Tim was, as usual, tucked away somewhere. I talked to Emma about my findings and she was shocked. This changed the entire approach to the investigation. We talked to Tim who reluctantly agreed to investigate the fire possibility. I was overjoyed. Emma was not. Emma was always the most fun and chatty person to work with. She also was the most experienced out of our team. She looked very funny because of her completely shaven hair. She had become increasingly upset. Her husband had died just after the plane crash but she had never told anyone how he died. Mary and Peter, like me, had recently joined and didn't take the work seriously enough. Soon afterwards, Mary went home and left for her one week vacation. I told Peter about the my fire idea and Peter agreed with me but only because he had absolutely no skills whatsoever. Tim didn't trust him and never told him anything that the others didn't know. His access was restricted and he was not given the passcode We continued with our work and found nothing else to form a new theory. It seemed that I was right. That night, I watched Tim lock up again and returned home. I arrived at the warehouse and was greeted by looks of shock and dismay. Vital evidence had been stolen and the door with the scorch marks was among the stolen things. The thief must have been an insider because no one outside knew about the fire theory. After my lunch break, I returned to the warehouse downhearted. Emma, who I was closest to, was leaving for a better paying job elsewhere. At the end of the month, she would be gone. Before I left work that day, I heard a clatter in the warehouse and told Tim to keep the doors open for me to investigate. At the back of the warehouse I found Mary snooping around and looking at the paper records. I shouted at her and she ran. We did not see her again for half a week. Mary couldn't have tampered with the evidence, could she? She did not have authorisation to open the cabinets they were stored in anyway and but did know the passcode. She didn't have a motive we knew about anyway. I spent the next week thinking about the case and Mary. She eventually returned and we didn't speak. I was the only one to know who was in the warehouse. I took a phone call for Valerie and an on site investigator had made some discoveries. Someone had found some other piece of burning wreckage and thrown it out to sea. A villager had been bribed by an unknown person to discard the burning wreckage and not tell anyone about it. There was a body and a pack of cigarettes found very nearby, in the sea and it was Emma's husband's body. He was a flight attendant whose body had very high levels of carbon monoxide. That was what had happened to him. But the identification of the body made no difference to the case. We had confirmed that there was a fire which went undetected. Bodies had higher levels of carbon monoxide. They had been poisoned by the fire and died before the plane hit the ground. And in a flash, I knew who had sabotaged the investigation. Who sabotaged the investigation?\nAnswer:","targets":["I confronted Emma. 'How did you know?', she asked horrified. I simply grinned and gave her my report. It included how Emma's husband was a flight attendant sitting next to the burning door and must have been incapacitated first. Emma was the only one to know that her husband had died in the plane crash and told villagers to discard the wreckage and cigarettes to make her husband to appear innocent.\n\n\nEmma began to cry. 'Why did you do it?', I asked her. 'Why did you have to go to all this trouble to try to exonerate your husband? He was dead. His reputation wouldn't have been dented. You could have asked for that information to be withheld.'. 'You don't understand' she said. 'I would be blamed for his actions. For the rest of my life, I would be a killer's wife.

{"inputs":"Story: \u201cI wanna ride your new bike!\u201d Mark whined. Matthew didn\u2019t even bother glancing away from the video game he was playing with his friend, String, to look at his little brother. \u201cNot a chance, short stuff,\u201d he said, zapping String\u2019s on-screen troll with a blue thunderbolt. Mark\u2019s lower lip and chin started to tremble. \u201cI\u2019m-I\u2019m telling Dad when he gets back!\u201d the nine-year-old shrieked at his older brother on the basement couch. \u201cHe said you were supposed to share the bike with me sometimes!\u201d \u201cGet lost,\u201d Matthew replied, thumbs flying, chasing String\u2019s game ogre up a beanstalk. Mark turned and stomped up the stairs. \u201cYou gotta relax your attitude about that bike, dude,\u201d String commented. \u201cIt\u2019s not made of glass, you know.\u201d \u201cGotcha!\u201d Matthew hollered, lopping the head off String\u2019s ogre with a golden sword. String threw down his controller in disgust. \u201cBut I\u2019ll get you \u2013 you can count on that, buddy-boy.\u201d String was so nicknamed because he was tall and skinny, and he always wore a piece of string tied around one bony wrist. He was a big-time practical joker, so Matthew didn\u2019t take his playful threat lightly. \u201cAnother water balloon from the third floor of the school?\u201d he asked blandly. \u201cOr maybe another rubber chicken in my lunch bag?\u201d String grinned evilly. \u201cYou won\u2019t know \u2018til it hits you, friend.\u201d The doorbell rang. Matthew jumped off the couch and ran up the stairs to the side door of his home. David was out on the driveway, sitting on his bike. The three pals \u2013 Matthew, String and David \u2013 had agreed to meet at Matthew\u2019s house, before joining their other friend, Cory, at the city park on the outskirts of town for a day of off-road biking. David looked up glumly, as Matthew opened the door and said, \u201cWhat up, D-man?\u201d \u201cI got a flat,\u201d the freckle-faced redhead replied, pointing at the bald back tire of his beat-up bicycle. Matthew stepped outside, looked at the pancaked rear tire. \u201cSure do.\u201d Something always seemed to be wrong with David\u2019s bike. \u201cHow\u2019d you make it over here?\u201d \u201cIt wasn\u2019t bad when I left my place.\u201d David got off the bike, dropped it down onto the concrete driveway with a crash. \u201cHey, mind if I ride your hot wheels over to the bike shop on the corner, to pick up a patch?\u201d Like all of the boys, David had wanted to take Matthew\u2019s new bike for a spin as soon as he\u2019d laid eyes on it, and he was more than a little resentful that his friend wouldn\u2019t let anyone even touch his cherry ride. \u201cUh \u2026 I don\u2019t think so,\u201d Matthew said. He glanced affectionately at his shiny new bicycle where it was chained up against the wall in the open garage. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take String\u2019s bike? He won\u2019t mind. Just come in when you\u2019ve got everything patched up and we\u2019ll all ride over to the park.\u201d He stepped back inside the house and shut the door. Half-an-hour later, David came down the stairs and found the two boys still in the basement, still playing video games. \u201cYou guys about ready to take off?\u201d he asked. \u201cIn a minute,\u201d Matthew replied, sending String\u2019s on-screen go-kart flying into a pile of hay bales and exploding in flames. \u201cFix your tire?\u201d String asked. \u201cYeah.\u201d David plopped down into a chair. \u201cI used some tools in your garage, Matthew, if that\u2019s alright?\u201d \u201cNo problemo,\u201d the curly haired boy responded, banging String\u2019s flaming wreck right off the track. After another half-hour, the boys finally turned off the big-screen TV and headed upstairs and outside. \u201cMy bike\u2019s gone!\u201d Matthew howled, staring at the empty spot in the garage his brand-new bicycle had so recently decorated. \u201cIt was here when I got back and was working on my bike,\u201d David said. \u201cThere it is!\u201d String shouted, pointing up the street. \u201cLooks like someone got to ride it whether you liked it or not.\u201d They all stared at Mark blithely riding up the street on his brother\u2019s bicycle, a look of glee on his beaming face. Until he saw Matthew come charging across their front lawn and out into the street. Then he yelped and jumped off the still rolling bike and ran off in the opposite direction as fast as his little legs would carry him. \u201cHow\u2019d he get the bike unchained from your garage?\u201d David asked, once he and String had caught up with Matthew in the middle of the street. \u201cThe punk\u2019s crafty,\u201d Matthew scowled, stroking the dust off his bike with a Kleenex. The boys mounted up and peddled on over to the city park. Cory was waiting for them at the entrance to the park, sitting on his own customized bike. \u201cI got a real rough track picked out for you squirts today,\u201d he said. The square-built blonde was half-a-year older than the rest of the boys and leader of the pack, as a result. \u201cThink you and your precious new tricycle can handle it, Matthew?\u201d \u201cThis baby can handle anything,\u201d Matthew sneered back, patting his chrome handlebars. They hit the trails, bouncing up and down a set of ruts that led through the forest, peddling hard up one side of a hill and then sailing down the opposite side, yelling with excitement. They crossed a bumpy crushed rock road and rattled along an abandoned railway track before speeding over a cedar chip path back into a wooded area, laughing and shouting. David, Cory and Matthew raced out ahead of String, flying around a corner in the path and out of sight. The beanpole made no effort to keep up. A minute later, he heard a horrific scream. String sped around the corner and skidded to a stop. Matthew was sprawled out on the ground, David off his bike and kneeling next to the whimpering boy. \u201cMy front wheel came off!\u201d Matthew wailed. He let David help him to his feet, nothing injured except his brand-new bike and his pride. Cory squatted down beside the busted bicycle and picked up two shiny metal nuts. They were the axle nuts that secured the front wheel to the front forks of the bike, and when they\u2019d come off, the wheel had come free, pitching Matthew right over the handlebars and onto the trail. \u201cThese babies must\u2019ve been deliberately loosened, to fly off a new bike like that,\u201d Cory said. \u201cLucky you weren\u2019t riding down a hill or something \u2013 you could\u2019ve really been hurt.\u201d \u201cSabotage!\u201d Matthew cried. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t one of your stupid practical jokes, was it?\u201d David asked String. String scratched his bony skull. \u201cWhat, and miss it? What\u2019s the point of a practical joke if you don\u2019t see it happen?\u201d \u201cWas anyone fooling around with your bike before you came here, Matthew?\u201d Cory asked. Matthew sniffled, brushing off his jeans and t-shirt. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think \u2026\u201d An angry gleam suddenly shone in his watery brown eyes. \u201cYeah, wait a minute-\u201d \u201cWait a minute, indeed,\u201d String interrupted. He walked over to Cory and popped the axle nuts out of the boy\u2019s hand and deftly caught them in his own hand. \u201cI know who loosened these,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we all know why.\u201d Who sabotaged the bike?\n  choice: David\n  choice: String\n  choice: Cory\n  choice: Mark\nAnswer:","targets":["David"],"multiple_choice_targets":["Cory","David","Mark","String"],"multiple_choice_scores":[0,1,0,0],"idx":77}
{"inputs":"Story: There was a knock on the door of 222c Butcher Street. The maid promptly answered the summons, ushered a large, sheepskin-jacketed man and a petite, lab-coated woman into the private study of full-time eccentric and part-time detective Sir Loch Hoames. \u201cAh!\u201d Hoames exclaimed, setting aside his cello and leaping out of his chair by the artificial fire. \u201cDr. Watt-Sun!\u201d He vigorously shook hands with the married veterinarian who operated an animal clinic three doors down from his rooms. \u201cSir Loch,\u201d she responded pleasantly, \u201cI\u2019d like you to meet Kinnair McMurray. He\u2019s a\u201d \u201cSheepsman, of course,\u201d Sir Loch interjected, examining the stout, ruddy-complexioned fellow. \u201cHe operates a hundred-acre gorse farm this side of Glasgow, on which he tends to two-hundred head of sheep and lambs. Married, with four young children, proud owner of a late-model lorry. You\u2019ve been shearing early this year, sir, due to your heavy debt load. But your dog has gone missing, and you\u2019d like me to find him.\u201d \u201cAstounding!\u201d Kinnair exulted. \u201cHow did you know all that?\u201d \u201cElementary. Right, my dear Watt-Sun? You see, I\u2019m one of the silent partners who hold the note on your ancestral McMurray farm, and, as such, am privy to all of your assets and liabilities and family history. As for the rest,\u201d Sir Loch waved his hand, \u201cwell, the excess wool on your coat attests to your recent shearing activities, and the presence of Scotland-renowned canine expert Dr. Watt-Sun attests to your mission.\u201d \u201cAmazing!\u201d the man marveled. \u201cBut enough chit-chat,\u201d Sir Loch said. \u201cHow and when did your dog happen to go missing, sir?\u201d Kinnair explained to the amateur sleuth how just three days earlier he had allowed a traveling troupe of four buskers to camp in a corner of his field for the night \u2013 a mime, a stilt-walker, a living statue and a balloon twister. The following morning, the troupe had vanished, along with Rover. \u201cHe\u2019s me best sheep-herding dog, is Rover,\u201d Kinnair lamented. \u201cNo other dog reacts to my oral commands better or quicker.\u201d \u201cTo Edinburgh!\u201d Hoames suddenly exclaimed, donning his deerstalker. Before Dr. Watt-Sun could question or protest, he added, \u201cThe Edinburgh Festival Fringe has just commenced, and it is most certainly to that three-week carnival of plays, performances and antics that our troupe has trekked.\u201d Within the hour, Dr. Watt-Sun and Sir Loch were disembarking from the express train to the Scottish capital. They made haste for the large encampment of entertainers known annually as Buskerville; a vast tent city to rival any Depression-era Hooverville. It was where the more cash-strapped fringe performers lived during the length of the festival. Sir Loch had disguised himself whilst on the train. He was decked out now in a green leotard, multi-pronged red-and-white belled headgear and Aladdin-like slippers. So attired as a frolicsome court jester and armed with a musical recorder and the detailed physical descriptions Kinnair had supplied of the suspect performers, he sought to infiltrate the camp. \u201cWho might you be?\u201d a burly juggler demanded to know, blocking his way. The man was juggling several large clubs, and it was obvious he knew how to use them for more than just show. Other camp denizens quickly surrounded the interloper, as well. Sir Loch immediately began cavorting about, gesticulating wildly, pratfalling constantly, raising a smile even on the scowled lips of the juggler. Then he wetted his own lips, affixed them to the recorder. A most heartrending version of Greensleeves piped out of the shrill instrument, tearing the eyes of his audience and convincing them of his authenticity. He was welcomed into the camp, along with his companion, Nurse Mirth (a\/k\/a Dr. Watt-Sun). Once within the enclave, Sir Loch flipped a switch on the underside of his pearl-white recorder and piped a note only a canine audience could appreciate. The dog whistle did the trick as hounds of all shapes and sizes came bounding down the rows of tents almost barreling the detective and doctor over. Watt-Sun quickly identified Rover from her veterinarian dealings with the pooch and collared and leashed the animal. \u201cAnd now to apprehend the dognapper,\u201d Sir Loch remarked. They located the mime first, attempting to escape from an invisible box. He was speechless in the face of Sir Loch\u2019s pointed questions, his lily-white face the picture of innocence. Rover licked one of the man\u2019s feet, and the mime yelled at the dog, but since there were no actual words, Rover paid no attention.\nSir Loch suddenly spun around, his bells jangling and stared upwards at the stilt-walker looking down upon the proceedings. \u201cYou there with your head in the clouds,\u201d he questioned, \u201cyou didn\u2019t steal this dog from the McMurray farm, did you?\u201d \u201cThat dog? No,\u201d the giant replied from twenty feet up. \u201cWhat use would I have for such a small dog?\u201d Sir Loch gestured at the duct tape wrapped tightly around the left wooden leg of the towering man. \u201cBroke your leg recently, I see.\u201d \u201cYeah, some little kid got tangled up in my feet a couple of weeks ago, made me stumble and snap a leg.\u201d \u201cIndeed. It must be difficult to keep track of youngsters from such a height.\u201d The man started striding away, and Rover barked wildly at a Chihuahua that was directly in the path of the lumbering giant, scaring the miniature dog away just before it was trampled. Dr. Watt-Sun screamed. Sir Loch whirled about. He observed that the vet had bumped into what looked amazingly like a Greek statue. Until the statue had moved, catching the good doctor in his muscled arms. \u201cThe living statue, I presume?\u201d Sir Loch commented, scrutinizing the half-naked, grey-painted man. \u201cAnd what do you know of the theft of Kinnair McMurray\u2019s dog?\u201d But the man had turned to stone again, striking an Apollo-like pose. Rover sniffed at the \u2018statue\u2019s\u2019 leg, then lifted one of his own. \u201cHey!\u201d the stony-faced performer yelled, jumping backwards before the dog could do any business. Both Rover\u2019s and Sir Loch\u2019s ears suddenly cocked, as they heard the unmistakable huffing and puffing of someone blowing up a balloon. Sure enough, three tent rows over, they came upon the balloon twister, the fourth member of the troupe who\u2019d once occupied a small corner of Kinnair McMurray\u2019s land. She stilled her lungs when Hoames, Watt-Sun and Rover approached, her balloon half-filled. There were other performers standing about watching the woman, and Rover began barking at them, his herding instincts getting the better of him. He nipped at their heels, forming the throng up into an orderly crowd in front of the balloon artist. \u201cHmmm,\u201d Sir Loch mused aloud, \u201cthat kind of canine talent would come in handy for gathering a crowd together \u2013 a paying crowd. Wouldn\u2019t it, twister?\u201d She shrugged, pursing her lips and puffing again. Rover watched, wide-eyed, as the rubber inflated. But when the balloon sculptor started making with the squeaky manipulations that rapidly twisted the white and black balloon into a spotted Dalmatian, Rover yelped and tried to run off in the opposite direction. Holding tight to the dog\u2019s leash, Dr. Watt-Sun said, \u201cI don\u2019t see how we\u2019re ever going to figure out who took Rover, Hoames.\u201d \u201cHa!\u201d Sir Loch exclaimed. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019re barking up the wrong tree there, my dear Watt-Sun. For I\u2019ve already determined the identity of the mangy culprit.\u201d Who stole Rover?\n  choice: Living Statue\n  choice: Stilt-Walker\n  choice: Balloon Twister\n  choice: Mime\nAnswer:","targets":["Stilt-Walker"],"multiple_choice_targets":["Balloon Twister","Living Statue","Mime","Stilt-Walker"],"multiple_choice_scores":[0,0,0,1],"idx":82}
{"inputs":"Story: Forest View House was an isolated mansion owned by an elderly man named Mr. Howard Peters. One wild, autumn night, Mr. Peters was entertaining guests and in the small hours of the morning screams awoke the occupants of the house. Miss Lucy Smith had looked out of her bedroom window and seen the limp form of Mr. Peters hanging from one of the garden trees and started to scream. Everyone rushed out to the hanging figure. After staring at it for several minutes however, they could see that it was not Mr. Peters himself but an old first aid dummy dressed in his clothes. The confused party made their way back to the house only to discover that a priceless painting had been stolen while they were outside. Since the dummy and its clothing had all been taken from the house it stood to reason that the perpetrator was someone at Forest View. The matter was made more sinister by the fact that all four guests were beneficiaries in their host\u2019s will. Mr. Peters telephoned for the police and an Inspector, a rake thin man named Alan Jefferies, duly arrived and promptly dropped down onto the nearest chair as though the walk from his car to the door of the house had exhausted him. The Inspector displayed his ID badge to the satisfaction of everyone except Dale whose poor vision compelled him to push forward to see properly and so tread on the Inspector\u2019s foot in the process. \u201cWell,\u201d said Jefferies, after he had ascertained that he did not have to add a hospital visit to the already eventful morning, \u201cI think someone should explain to me why you are all gathered here.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s like this,\u201d Mr. Peters began. \u201cI wanted my four closest friends to gather here for the weekend as I had business to discuss with them. They are Daisy Morris, Dale Clark, Lucy Smith and Iain Potts. Daisy is my niece and she resides with me permanently; the others arrived by train yesterday evening. We all had dinner together, during which I revealed some changes to my will, and then we all retired to bed.\u201d \u201cWhat was the gist of these changes?\u201d Inspector Jefferies broke in. \u201cThat there is no longer a fortune to be left to my four beneficiaries, at least not a very significant one, due to some bad investments I made. It was in the room where we had dinner that the missing painting was usually kept.\u201d \u201cContinue,\u201d the Inspector said, noting that all the guests bristled visibly at the mention of their damaged fortunes. \u201cWhy is everyone so concerned about this painting? It\u2019s not that valuable is it?\u201d Lucy asked. \u201cVery valuable, my dear,\u201d Mr. Peters muttered. \u201cWell,\u201d Lucy went on, \u201cit doesn\u2019t seem very fair to eliminate our inheritances when you own a pricy bit of art. Why didn\u2019t anyone tell me about it?\u201d \u201cYou went to the bathroom,\u201d Daisy explained to Lucy. \u201cYou weren\u2019t there when Uncle told us about the painting. It was only a passing remark as it doesn\u2019t affect the inheritance since it\u2019s bequeathed to the local first aid school in Uncle\u2019s will.\u201d \u201cI used to do volunteer work there,\u201d Mr. Peters explained. \u201cThat\u2019s why I have some equipment here in the house including the dummy that was used in this awful affair.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been led to understand that the house was roused by Lucy\u2019s screams,\u201d the Inspector said. \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Lucy replied. \u201cI had to get up at two in the morning to take some tablets.\u201d \u201cWere the other guests aware of that?\u201d Inspector Jefferies asked. \u201cYes they were. My windows look out onto the garden and I saw what I thought was poor Howard, murdered. I rushed out and one by one everyone else must have stumbled out of their rooms and followed to see what the matter was. I had only been staring at that frightful thing for a couple of minutes when Daisy came up behind me, Dale ran up next. It was very dark out there and all of a sudden we heard a yell and a crash. It turned out that Iain had tripped over one of the ropes used to secure what we now know was a dummy. That brought us all to our senses and we made our way back to the house.\u201d Inspector Jefferies looked over at a man waving shyly at him from the couch with one hand and nursing his leg with the other. \u201cHurt badly?\u201d Inspector Jefferies asked \u201cVery, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d Iain said sadly. \u201cExcellent,\u201d the Inspector said, apparently unaware of the surprise in the people around him, \u201cwho discovered that it was not a real body?\u201d \u201cIt was Dale who first made us aware of that,\u201d Daisy replied. \u201cWe all thought it was real. It was too dark to get a clear look at the features.\u201d \u201cMr. Peters, where were you during all this commotion?\u201d Inspector Jefferies asked. \u201cAs I am rather infirm, it took me a while to get myself out of bed and down the stairs. By the time I came down everyone had returned. The nearest phone is in the dining room and so I went in there to call the police.\u201d \u201cWe will proceed into that room Mr. Peters if you please, everyone else too,\u201d Inspector Jefferies instructed. As soon as the group entered the dining room a small spaniel tied up on the far side of the table began to yap frantically. He showed no sign of stopping until Daisy, who was the owner of the little creature, went over and petted him until he reluctantly quietened down. \u201cFor goodness sake, Daisy, from the moment I woke up all I could hear was that canine racket and when I came in here to call the police I could hardly hear myself over his noise. He flies into a frenzy when he sees anyone other than you, you need to get him trained, there\u2019s not a day goes by that-\u201d \u201cUncle, the policeman doesn\u2019t want to know about your domestic troubles,\u201d Daisy said. \u201cOh, doesn\u2019t he? Well, as I waited for the call to be answered I looked up at the wall here and that was when I saw that the painting had been stolen. Now, Inspector,\u201d said Mr. Peters, \u201cwill you search the rooms?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said the Inspector, \u201cno, I don\u2019t think I would like to do that, your house is exceptionally large.\u201d \u201c-but\u201d \u201cBesides,\u201d the Inspector continued, \u201cI don\u2019t need to search the house to tell you who took the painting.\u201d Who took the painting?\nAnswer:","targets":["\u201cIt is clear to me,\u201d the Inspector said, \u201cthat this revelation during dinner was a great blow to all four guests staying here. During dinner the conversation turns to the valuable painting and someone decides to steal it. It couldn\u2019t have been Lucy since she was not in the room when this painting was discussed.\n\nThe thief knew an attempt must be made without delay. They could have sneaked downstairs and taken the painting during the night if it were not for the spaniel that barks incessantly, it would certainly wake the household if an attempt were made and give the game away. The fact that the spaniel was barking when the painting was taken proves that it was not Daisy who stole it.\u201d\n\u201cIf I had come into the dining room my puppy would never have made a sound,\u201d Daisy said as she patted the dog.\n\n\u201cThe thief set up a distraction on the lawn,\u201d the Inspector continued,\u201d something sufficiently terrifying to get everyone to run out of the house with no thought for anything but the apparent murder. I suspect a little bit of sinister revenge played a part in this choice of distraction since the thief was angry with Mr. Peters.\n\nEveryone knew that Lucy had to get out of bed and take her medicine during the night and so the dummy was placed on the lawn underneath her window in order that she would give an alarm when she saw it.\n\nAs we know when the alarm came everyone rushed out, except for Mr. Peters who spent a long time rising from bed. At this point the dog was already barking so the thief had snuck down first and entered the dining room as soon as they heard Lucy\u2019s first scream, knowing that now the dog would be ignored in favour of the distraction on the lawn. The thief had only to take the painting, stash it somewhere in the house where they could get it later and then join the others.\n\nWhen the party ran out Iain tripped over a guide rope and hurt himself badly, he would never have had this accident if he had been aware of how the dummy was secured.\u201d\n\n\u201cHey! I\u2019d never have run and nearly broken my neck as well as twisting my ankle if I\u2019d been able to help it,\u201d Iain whined petulantly.\n\n\u201cThat was my point,\u201d the Inspector said very slowly.\n\n\u201cOh, oh I see,\u201d Iain said blushing.\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Inspector Jeffries said as he turned to look at Dale, \u201cthat only leaves one person.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat makes you think it was me for sure?\u201d Dale asked with a sly smile.\n\n\u201cBecause you demonstrated your poor eyesight when I showed my ID and yet it was you that apparently first managed to pierce the darkness with your vision and ascertain that the hanging figure was in fact a dummy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat would have been impossible,\u201d Lucy cried.\n\n\u201cIndeed it would have,\u201d the Inspector said, \u201cthe truth of the matter is that Dale here knew that all along because he was the one that put it there.\n\nI think a cursory examination of the house will reveal the painting\u2019s hiding place and if the rest of you handle your press interviews over these events sensibly I doubt that you will miss the inheritance money very much after all. Good day to you.\u201d"],"multiple_choice_targets":[],"multiple_choice_scores":[],"idx":218}
{"inputs":"Story: Jack Snyder had two great loves in his life: 1) old fashioned horror films (which by today\u2019s standards are not horror films at all) and 2) his family. His priorities were not necessarily in this order. One of the great joys of Jack\u2019s life was to invite one or more of his grandsons to spend Friday or Saturday night at his home. \u201cGranddad Jack\u201d and his grandsons would select a VHS tape or DVD from his extensive library and watch it in the family room after his wife, Candace, went to bed. The boys loved doing this. They felt like adults staying up later than their grandma. Also, Jack always made sure there was popcorn available. Turning off the family room lights and viewing an old black and white film on the big screen television added to the atmosphere. Andy, Matt and David genuinely enjoyed their granddad\u2019s old films. Dennis, at age seven, the youngest of the boys, did not enjoy the horror films as much as the others, but did like to stay up late and eat popcorn. One Friday evening just after school was out for the summer, Candace and Jack agreed to keep all four boys for the weekend so their parents could take a three-day mini vacation \u2013 alone. The boys ranged in age from 13-year-old Andy to 7-year-old Dennis. 11-year-old Matthew was especially excited as it was his turn to pick out what they would view on this early June Friday night. After dinner, Jack and the boys went upstairs to his office library, a converted bedroom where he kept his collection in what used to be the bedroom closet. The closet doors had been removed for ease of access and the boys never tired of looking at it. Jack placed great emphasis on keeping the tapes and DVDs chronicled and placed in alphabetical order. Tonight, as always, every film in his library was accounted for and in its proper place. After much deliberation, Matthew selected Fall of the House of Usher, a 1960 film starring the great Vincent Price as the tormented Roderick Usher. This was one of Jack\u2019s favorites. He was delighted that it was one of Matthew\u2019s as well -- he had selected this film several times when it was his turn to choose. They took the DVD downstairs and placed it by the television in the family room. Jack and the boys were all set for what they referred to as their \u201cLate Night Horror Show.\u201d But, before grandma\u2019s bedtime the evening lay before them. The Snyder\u2019s backyard was huge and was the place of many family gatherings. Jack played with the boys outside on the swing set and also engaged the boys in pitch and catch. Candace sat in the sandbox with Dennis, who would shortly be too old to enjoy this any longer. Candace lamented that David had tired of it at about the same age Dennis is now. The six of them stayed outside until dark, a little over two hours. David went inside once to get soft drinks for everyone. At 9:00 p.m., the family came inside to clean up and watch television until grandma\u2019s bedtime. The boys took turns showering and changing clothes in the downstairs bathroom. Jack dozed off in his chair as they prepared for the night. Candace was busy getting the boys clean clothes and watching bits of the news. After showering, Andy hobbled painfully to the kitchen for an apple. Candace gave him permission to sleep downstairs because he had twisted his ankle playing outside, and it was painful for him to climb the stairs. Matthew went upstairs to find his toothbrush but quickly yelled for Candace to come upstairs and help him find it. Matthew\u2019s overnight bag was in the guest bedroom opposite the top of the stairs, and she observed him searching in vain for the toothbrush. As Candace\u2019s bedtime approached, Jack went upstairs to turn off his computer, when he noticed his VHS copy of Attack of the 50 Foot Woman was missing from its place on the first row shelf. This was another of his favorites, a 1957 B horror\/science fiction film starring the cult scream queen, Allison Hayes. Jack knew immediately what had happened: One of his grandsons had given in to the temptation to borrow one of his films. He wasn\u2019t exactly mad, but was mildly annoyed as he had asked all of them not to do this numerous times. He was pleased that his grandsons shared his passion for these old films, though he wanted them to have more respect for his wishes. Going back downstairs, he called the family together and explained what he had found. Looking at all four of his grandsons, he said, \u201cFall of the House of Usher will begin when Attack of the 50 Foot Woman is returned to me.\u201d Nobody said anything. Finally, Candace said, \u201cI have seen and heard everything tonight.

{"inputs":"Story: I got the call from an excited Lawrence Horton at about 1:30 on Monday afternoon. Horton, an old movies fan, is the owner of The Blue Parrot Restaurant, which is not far from the newspaper where I work, for too little money, as Food and Wine Editor. \u201cCome right over. I need your help. Right now! Before this news gets all over town.\u201d He sounded desperate, like a heart attack ready to happen. I raced down the street and was there within a few minutes. Horton waved me into his office, and introduced me to a patron, William Saunders. \u201cYes,\u201d Saunders said, \u201cI read your column. You know your food and wines. So you\u2019ll appreciate that I don\u2019t like paying hundreds of dollars for what I did not order! My wife Caroline and I were celebrating our anniversary. We ordered a special meal, steaks with black mushrooms. That\u2019s what we got. But when I checked the credit card, it was for the truffles, at three times the cost of the meal we actually had! We came here on your recommendation, too!\u201d That made it personal. I was startled. After all, I had just run a special article on The Blue Parrot, which featured this very dish. Truffles were rare and expensive. I had never tried the black truffles from France or the equally expensive and rare white ones from Italy. That is, I had never tried them before the special tasting Mr. Horton set up before my column. He had an order, and so did I. Their cost was high -- reaching $1,500 a pound. These truffles grew randomly underground, and were difficult to find. They were usually found by specially trained dogs, or even pigs, which traced the truffle scent! They gave food an unforgettable flavor, rich with a touch of garlic. So tasting the real thing was a rare event, and charging for it without serving the dish was grand larceny. \u201cShow me where this happened,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd please try to keep the noise down,\u201d Horton added. \u201cThis\u2019ll get sorted out, I\u2019m sure,\u201d he added, trying to reassure both Saunders and himself. \u201cBelieve me, you won\u2019t have to pay for anything that you didn\u2019t order.\u201d Saunders shook his head in an I-told-you-so affirmation. I turned to Horton. \u201cI want to see everyone involved in the service.\u201d Horton summoned the waiter, Antoine, and the head waiter, Georges Monceau. \u201cWhat is the serving procedure?\u201d My question was directed at the headwaiter, who was also in charge of wines. Monceau answered crisply. Clearly he was a man who knew his business. \u201cI deliver the menus, both the wine and also the food menu, if Sally Horvats has not already done so. I then offer to be of any assistance. Sometimes I even get the orders, when there is a rush. Actually, Mr. Saunders is a very knowledgeable consumer, and something of a wine authority in his own right. He will sometimes check with me about a special dish or a vintage year. But this was a special occasion. He had already made up his mind that he wanted the steak with black mushroom sauce, and he ordered it and was served promptly, so no special assistance was needed from me.\u201d Saunders nodded in agreement. \u201cWhat happened then?\u201d Antoine answered: \u201cI gave the order to the chef, Sam Wheeler, and when the order was ready, I served it immediately to the customer.\u201d Monceau nodded in agreement. \u201cThen, I opened and served his wine, after the customer checked the label. After that, I would check back from time to time, to see if everything was all right. It seemed to be, and Mr. Saunders left his typical generous cash tip. Though, he was in a hurry to leave when he finished his meal. He just picked up his credit card and left.\u201d Antoine smiled in agreement. We all went into the kitchen. Horton introduced us to Sam Wheeler, a beefy man wearing a large, white chef\u2019s apron and cap. \u201cTell us about the truffle service,\u201d I said. \u201cJust take us through your routine.\u201d Sam Wheeler grunted a bit. \u201cThose are special orders,\u201d he began. \u201cBy that, I mean that each is cooked to order, never prepared in advance. Truffles are not cooked very long. If they were, they might lose some of the flavor that the customer is paying such a premium for,\u201d he said.\n\t\n\u201cShow me the truffles.\u201d\n\t\nHe pointed to a medium-sized jar. I picked it up. It was a French import from a famous and respected shipping house. \u201cWe had just two jars,\u201d he said, pointing to a hall-full jar: \u201cI cook in front of the entire staff, they know we used one jar last week, and this is what remains from the second jar -- after three orders today. We\u2019ll run out entirely soon.\u201d \u201cHow many orders can you make per jar?\u201d \u201c \u2026 About six.\u201d \u201cDo you get many orders for steak with black mushrooms?\u201d \u201cSure, plenty of them. It\u2019s something of a specialty here. A good dish, certainly. But not the same as steak and truffles!\u201d \u201cHave you cooked truffles before?\u201d I asked. He bristled a bit, but admitted that he had seen it done when he was in culinary school, but had never before done it himself. They were just too expensive for student chefs to handle. \u201cCould there be a mistake, with one dish ordered and the wrong one served?\u201d \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, I never serve the two together in the same dish. If the customer ordered steak with truffle sauce, and got mushrooms instead, there has been either a mistake or a crime.\u201d They were stunned. We left the kitchen, and Antoine and Georges Manceau went back to their stations. Saunders left, somewhat pacified that the matter was being closely investigated. I took Horton aside and asked to see the daily receipts. He introduced Sally Horvats, the hostess who doubled as cashier. A troubled-looking brunette, she came over at Horton\u2019s nod. \u201cNo, I really didn\u2019t see anything,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a busy day, and there was just time to seat Mr. and Mrs. Saunders and give them their food menus. And then some more customers appeared at the front door, and I had to go and greet them.\u201d She was nervous, and I remembered why. Horton had told me that she was on parole for petty larceny. He was giving her a chance to redeem herself, a chance that, over the last six months, had seemed justified. \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Horton said. \u201cShe was on duty all last week, but couldn\u2019t have been at any table more than a couple of minutes.\u201d A new thought came to me. \u201cHow about the day\u2019s receipts, Mr. Horton? And last week\u2019s too, while you\u2019re at it.\u201d We went to his office. Everything seemed to be in order. There were three orders for today, and six orders of the special truffled steaks for last week, including the order for the Saunders luncheon, and there were also six credit card duplicates for those orders. \u201cSo it was just a mistake after all,\u201d Horton said. \u201cThis proves it.\u201d I thought for a minute. \u201cNo, Mr. Horton. It was grand larceny. I know who switched the orders,\u201d I said.

{"inputs":"Story: Lauren Cross-Highsmith sat in the kitchen of her aunt, Marge Cross Benson. Lauren was not only her aunt\u2019s favorite niece, but the two women shared a keen interest in the Cross family history. And Marge would soon share her knowledge of the Cross family and a mystery going back to the first years following the Civil War. After a few minutes of pleasant small talk, Marge reflected that, \u201cThe Cross family homestead is located in the central part of Kansas, a little over 80 miles away. The main house is 140 years old and sits high above modern civilization in the middle of the Flint Hills. Once, the Cross family had been prominent in the area but the community long ago became a distant memory for old-timers and a curiosity for historians. Pioneers failed at farming and moved away because the ground was so rocky that nothing would grow. In most places, you could barely get a spade or plow into the ground. Jack and I only visit the old house sporadically -- three or four times a year at the most. Because of its remote location and status as a historical site, the state of Kansas generously assists with its upkeep.\u201d Lauren was aware that what everyone these days referred to simply as \u201cThe House\u201d was huge and very impressive. Marge continued, \u201cThe House contains 21 rooms. Construction was finished in 1870. The homestead included horse stables, a wash and laundry room and another small building that served as a tool shed. A garden was added for Susie Cross in 1876 and an old style round barn for a few head of cattle Wilbur purchased a couple of years after that. Legend has it that Wilbur had several wagon loads of topsoil brought in for Susie\u2019s garden.\u201d Marge stopped and smiled before adding, \u201cBut not all was perfect in paradise. Kansas winds blew the topsoil away and Leonard finally moved the wash room to the barn in 1905. The water pipes leading to the water well leaked ever since the house was constructed and the laundry room had experienced recurring flooding.\u201d Marge paused. \u201cWould you help me solve a mystery concerning the House?\u201d Lauren answered, \u201cSure. What mystery?\u201d Marge smiled. She knew her young niece would relish what she was about to tell her. She began her tale as she added fresh ice to the tea tumblers. \u201cFamily records show that Wilbur and Susie enjoyed a happy and prosperous marriage. A son, Leonard, was born early in 1873 and his brother, Victor, in the fall of 1876. Both sons stayed on the homestead until the end of World War 1, working for their father and tending to his varied business interests. Victor married Edith in 1901.\u201d Lauren sat facing Marge in rapt attention. Marge continued, \u201cThere has been a story in our family for as long as the House has existed that there is hidden fortune somewhere on the property. Now, it was not uncommon for people to bury their money and valuables on family farms and homesteads in the depression days of the 1930s, but legend has it that great-grandfather Wilbur stashed something of value sometime after establishing the Cross House in 1869.\u201d \u201cA Cross treasure!\u201d Lauren chimed in. \u201cWilbur was quite a man. He was a Civil War veteran who served with distinction in the Union Army. After the war, he headed west to work on the railroad. He was with Leland Stanford in Utah when the railroad connecting the country was completed in 1869. It was after that when he came to Kansas and built the family homestead. He made his money by purchasing Kansas farmland cheap and by selling it high.\u201d \u201cWhat did he hide?\u201d asked Lauren. \u201cThe story is so old, we\u2019re not certain, but Jack and I spent the night up there a couple of weeks ago. Let me show you what we found in the back of the basement closet. It was so dark that I almost missed it even with a powerful flashlight.\u201d Marge excused herself from the table long enough to retrieve a large, leather bound volume from the study. It looked to be very old. Placing it in front of her niece, she said, \u201cI didn\u2019t know this existed. Unlike most journals, there are entries from several different family members. There are five references to the hidden treasure, but all of them tell a different story by a different family member. The last entry in the journal, written by Uncle Hollis (son of Victor and Edith) in 1947, promises that only one of the five narrations is completely true.\u201d \u201cWhat does the last entry say?\u201d The legend was changed several times through the years to keep the fortune secret and safe. Choose well, because the wrong selection will cost you time and money. \u201cAh, the intrigue,\u201d Lauren gasped. \u201cI\u2019ve placed post-it notes on the entries you need to read.\u201d Lauren quickly turned to the first narration: Entry of Wilbur Cross, dated January 23, 1871: Look for gold buried six feet under the flat tombstone in the back pasture. I stole it from a Union payroll train in Elmira, New York just before the war ended. They\u2019ve been looking for me ever since. It\u2019s why I moved to such an out of the way place. She quickly moved on to the entry of Wilbur\u2019s wife, Susie. Entry of Susie Cross, dated July 4, 1889: Pa died a couple days ago. Not much of an Independence Day for me. At least I know he died rich. He told me the Federal men are still looking for the gold spike he stole when working on the transcontinental railroad 20 years ago. It was to be the last spike in the track and a symbol of the settlement of the west. Stashing it away was one of the first things he did when the house was completed. It is hidden in a false floor in the upper loft of the round barn. Next, Lauren read the entries of Leonard and Victor Cross. Entry of Leonard Cross, dated, June 12, 1919: Life has not been the same since the Great War ended. Victor moved off of the homestead to work a city job. That\u2019s understandable as the world is changing. Before he left, he helped me move to a new hiding place a chest of silver nuggets that Dad accepted as payment for a huge parcel of land shortly before his death. Look in the basement closet. There is a false wall. Entry of Victor Cross, dated March 3, 1925: It\u2019s been a year since Leonard passed away. He was a leap year baby and died on his birthday. I\u2019m the last of our immediate family as Mom died just before the turn of the century many years ago. She wanted to live to see the 1900s, but that is another story. What I want to say is this: Dad didn\u2019t trust banks. Look for some very valuable stocks and bonds hidden in the wall behind the ice box in the kitchen. Finally, Lauren read the entry of Edith Cross. Entry of Edith Cross, dated January 31, 1936: There are a lot of people that don\u2019t trust banks these days, but granddad never did trust them. Perhaps it was because he was a crook himself. So, if whoever finds this will lift the southeast corner floorboards in the old wash room, you will find a big box full of 100 and 500 dollar bills from the 1880s. Lauren took a few moments to consider everything she had read. Finally, Marge asked, \u201cWell, what do you think?\u201d Lauren smiled, \u201cI believe I have some good news.\u201d Which journal contains the truth?\n  choice: Journal entry of Leonard\n  choice: Journal entry of Wilbur\n  choice: Journal entry of Susie\n  choice: Journal entry of Edith\n  choice: Journal entry of Victor\nAnswer:","targets":["Journal entry of Leonard"],"multiple_choice_targets":["Journal entry of Edith","Journal entry of Leonard","Journal entry of Susie","Journal entry of Victor","Journal entry of Wilbur"],"multiple_choice_scores":[0,1,0,0,0],"idx":67}
