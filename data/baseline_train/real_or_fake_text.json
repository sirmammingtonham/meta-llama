The Reform Party, building on anti-tax sentiment, strong feelings against immigrants and traditional opposition to Ottawa-based politicians, virtually swept Canada's two most western provinces, taking 46 of 58 Parliamentary seats in British Columbia and Alberta on Monday. The western victories put the party just two short of being the official opposition in Canada. Bloc Quebecois finished with 54 seats, all of them from its French Canadian stronghold of Quebec. The Reform Party took 52 seats in all. The Liberal Party gained 178 of Canada's 295 Parliamentary seats. Polls showed the Reformists were expected to get just 12 seats. \"We're going to be the third largest party,\" said Conservative MP Ted Opitz, a former Reform politician who is now running for his old seat in Vancouver Island.

The \"Blue Menace\" referred to one of the two races that had been at war on our planet for the last 7 years. Their natural pigment was blue, but like chameleons or cuttlefish, they were able to alter the appearance of their skin to a near perfect reproduction of the scene around them. The only flaw seemed to be in reproducing written languages - if the Blue in question didn't know the language, it could't imprint it. English text would just look blurry and unfocused, as if you had forgotten your glasses. Despite this, 100% translation was still possible with improvised communication devices or over open broadcasts, under certain conditions. Cultural barriers presented a far greater problem however - which is why so many nations would send soldiers into an area to erase all trace of themselves, to wipe off every printable clue that could help potential invaders reach certain territories.

The Roman empire would be lead through the next 6050 years of recorded time by the mysterious leader known as Pretzel Master -- there is no record to indicate why he would have been given such a ridiculous name. Through numerous battles catalyzed by an accidental attack upon the Babylonians while trying to come to terms on a primitive trade agreement, the Romans would gradually expand their empire as their enemy slowly crumbled. Though more culturally advanced and far more economically prosperous, they would be unable to match the rabidly-militaristic Romans, who spent virtually all of the research time and money into the creation of the world's largest army. It was a risky move that soon saw their economy begin to falter in enormous busts. Up until roughly 1990, the Romans waged a constant war of expansion, forcibly seeking the seemingly genocidal annihilation of even those civilizations that had never before caused it any arm. The Romans were also one of the first civilizations to develop a form of religion based around the worship of the sun god. This was not a new concept at this point, but rather a continuation of the ancient practice of using the moon as a symbol for the sun. The Roman Empire was able to use this religious symbolism to its advantage when they conquered many of the surrounding cultures, which were still worshipping the sun god. By adopting the sun god as their own, the Romans could then effectively control the entire solar system.\n  choice: Through numerous battles catalyzed by an accidental attack upon the Babylonians while trying to come to terms on a primitive trade agreement, the Romans would gradually expand their empire as their enemy slowly crumbled.\n  choice: By adopting the sun god as their own, the Romans could then effectively control the entire solar system.\n  choice: The Romans were also one of the first civilizations to develop a form of religion based around the worship of the sun god.\n  choice: Around 4000 BC, the world saw the emergence of numerous civilizations; the Babylonians, Egyptians, Romans and Greeks all began to surface in their fetal forms.\n  choice: Though more culturally advanced and far more economically prosperous, they would be unable to match the rabidly-militaristic Romans, who spent virtually all of the research time and money into the creation of the world's largest army.\n  choice: It was a risky move that soon saw their economy begin to falter in enormous busts.\n  choice: Up until roughly 1990, the Romans waged a constant war of expansion, forcibly seeking the seemingly genocidal annihilation of even those civilizations that had never before caused it any arm.\n  choice: The Roman empire would be lead through the next 6050 years of recorded time by the mysterious leader known as Pretzel Master -- there is no record to indicate why he would have been given such a ridiculous name.\n  choice: The Roman Empire was able to use this religious symbolism to its advantage when they conquered many of the surrounding cultures, which were still worshipping the sun god.\n  choice: This was not a new concept at this point, but rather a continuation of the ancient practice of using the moon as a symbol for the sun.\nFIRST COMPUTER-GENERATED SENTENCE:","targets":["The Romans were also one of the first civilizations to develop a form of religion based around the worship of the sun god."],"multiple_choice_targets":["Around 4000 BC, the world saw the emergence of numerous civilizations; the Babylonians, Egyptians, Romans and Greeks all began to surface in their fetal forms.","The Roman empire would be lead through the next 6050 years of recorded time by the mysterious leader known as Pretzel Master -- there is no record to indicate why he would have been given such a ridiculous name.","Through numerous battles catalyzed by an accidental attack upon the Babylonians while trying to come to terms on a primitive trade agreement, the Romans would gradually expand their empire as their enemy slowly crumbled.","Though more culturally advanced and far more economically prosperous, they would be unable to match the rabidly-militaristic Romans, who spent virtually all of the research time and money into the creation of the world's largest army.","It was a risky move that soon saw their economy begin to falter in enormous busts.","Up until roughly 1990, the Romans waged a constant war of expansion, forcibly seeking the seemingly genocidal annihilation of even those civilizations that had never before caused it any arm.","The Romans were also one of the first civilizations to develop a form of religion based around the worship of the sun god.","This was not a new concept at this point, but rather a continuation of the ancient practice of using the moon as a symbol for the sun.","The Roman Empire was able to use this religious symbolism to its advantage when they conquered many of the surrounding cultures, which were still worshipping the sun god.","By adopting the sun god as their own, the Romans could then effectively control the entire solar system."],"multiple_choice_scores":[0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0],"idx":2091,"is_generated":false,"true_idx":6524},{"inputs":"You will be presented with a document containing 10 sentences.

The drought -- more than 60 days with no rain and temperatures in the 90's -- arrived after food stocks were already severely depleted by two years of floods and decades of economic ruin wrought by the most bizarre of Communist systems, which is now struggling to feed itself without allies. The relief officials acknowledged that they could not move freely in North Korea and that their visits were tightly controlled by Communist authorities, making the extent of what some experts have called an ''invisible'' catastrophe hard to gauge. The ruling by a three-judge panel was the court's second decision in less than a year in a pair of closely related cases involving the administration's interpretations of a complex section of the Clean Air Act. Unlike its ruling last summer, when the court largely upheld the E.P.A.'s approach against challenges from industry, state governments and environmental groups, the new ruling was a defeat for the agency and for industry, and a victory for the states and their environmentalist allies. In the earlier case, a panel including two of the three judges who ruled on Friday decided that the agency had acted reasonably in 2002, when it issued a rule changing how pollution would be measured, effectively loosening the strictures on companies making changes to their equipment and operations. But on Friday, the court said the agency went too far in 2003 when it issued a separate new rule that opponents said would exempt most equipment changes from environmental reviews -- even changes that would result in higher emissions. With a wry footnote to Lewis Carroll's ''Through the Looking Glass,'' the court said that ''only in a Humpty-Dumpty world'' could the law be read otherwise.

A key concept in the court's opinion was its equating a physician's withdrawal or withholding of life support in a terminally ill patient with prescribing medication so that the patient could commit suicide. Most physicians who deal with critically ill patients would reject this logic outright. If death is imminent, then withholding or withdrawing life support is  appropriate because it prevents the prolongation of the dying process. This is indeed more \"natural\" and morally acceptable than prescribing a lethal dose of medication to a sentient, reasoning, albeit suffering, human being. The latter is morally reprehensible and emotionally repugnant to a large  majority of doctors because it is an act that leads directly to suicide: the premeditated snuffing out of a human life. I have dealt with terminally ill patients for 25 years. The question of assisted suicide comes up rarely and can be dealt with both pharmacologically and with psychiatric help. Palliative care greatly facilitates life with dignity and lessened quality of life at the end of one's life.

After a week of near constant flirting and deliberate innuendo Chase Donahue had finally taken a chance. It was the kind of chance that every guy dreams about, right? As he walked through the door into the club's ballroom one evening, there was no sign of Tony Donahue anywhere. He looked around to see if anyone else might have heard him but the place was completely deserted.

The apartment's 10-foot ceilings make it higher than it is wide, with much more wall space than floor space. The front room, with two windows on the street, spans nine feet, wall to wall. About 50 feet and three rooms back, the seven-foot-wide rear wall is barely able to contain a loft bed. Mr. Lee, who is six feet tall and weighs 146 pounds, can hold out his arms and nearly touch both sides of his bedroom at the same time. But for Mr. Lee, 56, the beauty of this Chelsea apartment, which he shares with his wife, Sue Anne, 51, and their 10-year-old daughter, is in its depths.

The teammate, the son of a lottery millionaire serving a prison sentence for murder, has been charged with second-degree assault. Law enforcement officials said today that they were not sure whether they would file additional charges as a result of the death. '' We're awaiting reports from the medical examiner's office, and will conduct a thorough review of the case and determine how to proceed based on that review,'' said Anne Marie Corbalis, a spokeswoman for the Westchester County district attorney's office. The injured player, Robert Viscome, 17, who had been in a coma since the party, was removed from life support at Westchester Medical Center on Tuesday afternoon and died about five hours later with his family by his side, police officials said. '' This has been a horrible tragedy for all of us,'' the Viscome family said in a written statement. '' It will forever leave a hole in the fabric of our family and our community. We can only hope that Robert did not die in vain and that young people everywhere may better realize that a few seconds of violence can end one young person's life, ruin another's life, and indelibly affect the lives of those who love them.'' The victim is believed to have been playing quarterback for the Stuyvesant High School team when he was attacked by a group of players who were part of a group called the 'Pistol Pack.' According to witnesses, the group of boys began throwing punches at the victim after he made a pass to a teammate.\n  choice: We can only hope that Robert did not die in vain and that young people everywhere may better realize that a few seconds of violence can end one young person's life, ruin another's life, and indelibly affect the lives of those who love them.''\n  choice: According to witnesses, the group of boys began throwing punches at the victim after he made a pass to a teammate.\n  choice: The teammate, the son of a lottery millionaire serving a prison sentence for murder, has been charged with second-degree assault.\n  choice: A high school football player died Tuesday night of head injuries he received last week during an after-school drinking party where, police officials said, he was punched in the jaw by a teammate and fell onto a concrete patio.\n  choice: This has been a horrible tragedy for all of us,'' the Viscome family said in a written statement.

Now, only two remain independent. The Wachovia Corporation swallowed up A. G. Edwards yesterday in a $6.8 billion cash and stock deal that highlights the continued consolidation of the retail brokerage sector. Bringing together more than $1.1 trillion in client assets and nearly 15,000 advisers, the move aims to expand Wachovia's reach in the securities business as it faces more difficult times in other parts of the banking industry. The deal will make Wachovia Securities the country's second-largest retail broker after Merrill Lynch, allowing it to take advantage of the cost efficiencies that come with size and to sell bank products to a bigger base of affluent clients. It also could enhance the capabilities of its fledgling investment bank, giving clients access to a broader network of retail investors for distributing new securities offerings. '' This is an important step forward,'' said Stephen Sanger, president of the National Association of Securities Dealers. The combined firm will have more than 300 employees and about $2 billion in annual revenue. The merger, which has been approved by regulators, will be subject to regulatory approval from the Federal Reserve Board.

There are only so many times you can get thrown into a dumpster by a cheating spouse's new lover before you start to feel like garbage.

It doesn't help if your eyes hurt or go red when they're wet and at night it makes things worse - especially with an infrequent naps after work (I know this sounds crazy because I've been through some bad experiences myself).

Lawyers for the couple, Raymond and Vanessa Jackson, said they expected to call Bruce Jackson, the 19-year-old adopted son who was found rummaging through a neighbor's garbage looking for food in October of 2003, as a witness. The Jacksons were indicted in May on eight counts of aggravated assault and 20 counts of endangering the welfare of a child in the second degree. The prosecutor alleges that the couple not only abused Bruce and the three other boys, but three girls as well. '' We are confident that Mr. Jackson will be called by the defense,'' attorney James J. McGinnis Jr., told Judge Michael R. Caffrey. '' He is a very credible witness.'' McGinnis said he would also call Bruce Jackson's biological father, William L. \"Bill\" Williams, a retired police officer from Springfield, Mass. He declined to say whether the two men had spoken since the indictment.

The ruling by the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court expands an earlier order halting sandblasting only on the Williamsburg Bridge, and addresses again the well-known health hazards of lead-paint residue. While only a few words in the latest ruling by the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court differ from the court's earlier ruling, the new decree has far-reaching effects. The case began with a lawsuit filed against the city by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 2009, alleging that the city had failed to comply with federal regulations requiring it to remove lead paint from its buildings. In 2010, the EPA sued the city for failing to remove lead paint from public housing units. The suit was dismissed in 2011, but the EPA appealed. In 2012, the city agreed to pay $2 million to settle the EPA's claims. In 2013, the city sought permission from the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court to continue removing lead paint from public housing units. But the city also asked the court to allow it to conduct \"environmental remediation\" activities on the bridge, including sandblasting. The city argued that the sandblasting would be done at no cost to taxpayers, because the work would not require any construction or demolition.\n  choice: The suit was dismissed in 2011, but the EPA appealed.\n  choice: But the city also asked the court to allow it to conduct \"environmental remediation\" activities on the bridge, including sandblasting.\n  choice: The case began with a lawsuit filed against the city by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 2009, alleging that the city had failed to comply with federal regulations requiring it to remove lead paint from its buildings.\n  choice: A state court has blocked sandblasting on all New York City bridges, pending environmental studies and public hearings, in a ruling that deepens a controversy arising from lead-paint removal on the Williamsburg Bridge.\n  choice: The ruling by the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court expands an earlier order halting sandblasting only on the Williamsburg Bridge, and addresses again the well-known health hazards of lead-paint residue.\n  choice: In 2010, the EPA sued the city for failing to remove lead paint from public housing units.\n  choice: While only a few words in the latest ruling by the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court differ from the court's earlier ruling, the new decree has far-reaching effects.\n  choice: In 2013, the city sought permission from the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court to continue removing lead paint from public housing units.\n  choice: In 2012, the city agreed to pay $2 million to settle the EPA's claims.\n  choice: The city argued that the sandblasting would be done at no cost to taxpayers, because the work would not require any construction or demolition.\nFIRST COMPUTER-GENERATED SENTENCE:","targets":["The case began with a lawsuit filed against the city by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 2009, alleging that the city had failed to comply with federal regulations requiring it to remove lead paint from its buildings."],"multiple_choice_targets":["A state court has blocked sandblasting on all New York City bridges, pending environmental studies and public hearings, in a ruling that deepens a controversy arising from lead-paint removal on the Williamsburg Bridge.","The ruling by the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court expands an earlier order halting sandblasting only on the Williamsburg Bridge, and addresses again the well-known health hazards of lead-paint residue.","While only a few words in the latest ruling by the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court differ from the court's earlier ruling, the new decree has far-reaching effects.","The case began with a lawsuit filed against the city by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 2009, alleging that the city had failed to comply with federal regulations requiring it to remove lead paint from its buildings.","In 2010, the EPA sued the city for failing to remove lead paint from public housing units.","The suit was dismissed in 2011, but the EPA appealed.","In 2012, the city agreed to pay $2 million to settle the EPA's claims.","In 2013, the city sought permission from the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court to continue removing lead paint from public housing units.","But the city also asked the court to allow it to conduct \"environmental remediation\" activities on the bridge, including sandblasting.","The city argued that the sandblasting would be done at no cost to taxpayers, because the work would not require any construction or demolition."],"multiple_choice_scores":[0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0],"idx":5938,"is_generated":false,"true_idx":10371},{"inputs":"You will be presented with a document containing 10 sentences.

Less than five years later, a new Congress is busily ripping it apart -- at a time when, more than ever, Americans are in desperate need of decent, affordable day care for their children. Consider women who are receiving Aid to Families With Dependent Children. Americans want to see them off the dole and into independence. But instead they're being forced to choose between work and childcare. The first bill signed by President George H.W. Bush provided $2 billion over two years to states to provide child care services for low-income families. In 1994 Congress extended this program through 1997. By 1996 it had been expanded to include vouchers for private day care centers. And now, under the 1996 Child Care and Development Block Grant Act, states can receive up to 50 percent of their total costs from federal funds. This means that even though most parents don't have access to subsidized child care, they still pay for about half of all such expenses.\n  choice: The first bill signed by President George H.W.

Later I thought of it as dapper, the way she'd pose atilt with one ear outstretched and the other tucked back, a jaunty salute for everyone and no one. Now I thought the gesture was world-weary, pained, expressive of sadness and resignation at the cruelty of uncaring fate. No, of course that's not how she felt. It's how I felt. She couldn't really jump up into the car any more, but her tail still wagged as I lifted her into the passenger seat.

Giant cable systems like Quantum, Time Warner's 150-channel service in Queens, have the capacity to deliver dozens of movies around the clock. Technologies like digital compression, which squeezes 3 to 10 programs into a single channel, could eventually increase that number to thousands. Where does that leave the video store?

Blockbuster offered $14.50 a share, surpassing a bid of $13.25 a share made last month by Movie Gallery and raising the $11.50 offer that Blockbuster made in November. The newest proposal offers $11 in cash and $3.50 in Blockbuster stock. Hollywood Entertainment and Movie Gallery have already entered into an merger agreement, but that can be stopped if more than 50 percent of Hollywood's shares are acquired by Blockbuster. The move by Blockbuster was not a surprise. It issued a statement last month saying that it remained committed to the acquisition. Blockbuster is far larger than the other two video chains. Its $2.7 billion market capitalization makes it three times bigger than CinemaNow, which operates mostly at malls and has a smaller, $400 million market cap.

The registered Democrats in the nation's capital outnumber Republicans by more than  11 to 1, and even independents dwarf Republicans by nearly 2 to 1. That has kept Republicans out of most significant elected offices since local residents were given the right to elect their own leaders more than 20 years ago under a plan known as Home Rule. But as the city tries to climb out of a financial crisis that led to the creation of a financial control board in the spring, it has been a Republican, Speaker Newt Gingrich, who has played a leading role in resolving the city's management and fiscal problems. Acting as a buffer between House Republicans with ambitious ideas for reshaping local government and city officials who want to protect the limited autonomy they have, Mr. Gingrich has shepherded the factions along a path lined  with political thorns. House Republicans, many of them acolytes of Mr. Gingrich, are eager to flex their muscles of fiscal conservatism by reversing years of overspending and questionable management practices. They have proposed such bedrock Republican notions as eliminating all financing for abortions as a condition of the city's  winning its 1996 appropriation from Congress, a $660 million subsidy for taxes that are not paid by Government agencies, foreign embassies and not-for-profit institutions. And they have also called for cutting off federal funding for the city's public schools, which would be replaced by vouchers that could be used at private or parochial schools. \"The only thing we're going to get out of this is a lot of money,\" said Representative John A.

UAL, the parent company of United Airlines, said it lost $64 million in the fourth quarter of 1993, while Delta reported a loss of $141 million. Losses for both airlines were narrower than in the similar quarter of 1992, in part because of lower fuel prices, improved productivity and an increase in traffic in November during the strike by American Airlines' flight attendants. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration provided a briefing on the matter to the committee today but did not say anything publicly. After the briefing, the ranking Democrat on the committee, John Dingell of Michigan, said that the highway agency ''could not and would not now say that any tires on Chairman Tauzin's list, including the Ford replacement tires, were bad.'' But Mr. Tauzin, in a statement issued a few minutes later, said that the agency ''could not and would not say that any of the replacement tires in question were safe.'' Ford said it had no new information from the agency and was proceeding with its replacement program.

But one place in which the new Administration has not talked much about drilling is off Florida, where the Interior Department is in the final stages of seeking public comment about a proposal to auction off rights to a six-million-acre field in the Gulf of Mexico. The federal government -- that is, the administration of George W. Bush -- is facing opposition to its exploration plans from the governor of Florida, Jeb Bush. '' I am confident,'' Governor Bush wrote in a letter on Tuesday to the acting secretary of the interior, Thomas Slonaker, ''that the new administration will recognize the need to protect sensitive natural resources located both offshore and along Florida's coastline for the benefit of the entire nation.'' The issue is important to Governor Bush, the president's younger brother, whose political future may hinge on his ability to stop this and other new drilling off the Florida coast. But President Bush will hear from others with a very different view. Oil companies that helped finance his campaign and that have allies in the cabinet have already been pressing to ease drilling restrictions along  the Florida and California coasts. They cite the recent surge in gas prices to bolster their arguments. The Interior Department has said it would seek bids by mid-June for the sale of the lease area, but the process could take months or years.

But the administration said later that the regulations would still go into effect today because it had given notice that it would appeal the court order, thus staying the order. In fact, the issue of whether the stricter rules go into effect today will be settled in further court action. The order was issued by Justice Alice Schlesinger of State Supreme Court in Manhattan and was intended to delay the new regulations until the judge permanently assigned to the case could hear it on its merits. Justice Schlesinger's ruling came in a lawsuit brought by a coalition of legal, consumer and medical groups  to permanently block the new rules.

Testaverde slipped as he released a pass and he fell near the feet of Coach Al Groh. But out of the corner of his eye, Groh could see that Testaverde was not clutching at his left leg, as he did when he tore his Achilles' tendon in the 1999 season opener last September. That agony was not fissuring his face again. Testaverde was down, wearing the wrong pair of shoes for the damp artificial turf, but the hopes for a new season had not slipped away again. '' Ray Lucas came running over to help me up,'' Testaverde said. '' That was probably a good test for me, too, to know I can roll the ankle and get up.'' The Jets are hoping that Testaverde will be ready for training camp next month. He is expected to compete with Mark Sanchez for the starting quarterback job. The Jets also hope that they can re-sign free agent wide receiver Santonio Holmes, who has been on injured reserve since March because of a torn ACL.\n  choice: The Jets are hoping that Testaverde will be ready for training camp next month.\n  choice: He is expected to compete with Mark Sanchez for the starting quarterback job.\n  choice: That agony was not fissuring his face again.\n  choice: But out of the corner of his eye, Groh could see that Testaverde was not clutching at his left leg, as he did when he tore his Achilles' tendon in the 1999 season opener last September.\n  choice: The Jets also hope that they can re-sign free agent wide receiver Santonio Holmes, who has been on injured reserve since March because of a torn ACL.\n  choice: Ray Lucas came running over to help me up,'' Testaverde said.

So if someone buys two copies of Eminem's 2001 single \"Sing For The Moment\" in Italy, for example, they're simply reselling him back to the company, which then recycles the discs into more albums.\n  choice: They've built a website that lets anyone access their digital music library\u2014an enormous collection that spans decades and many continents.\n  choice: A couple who call themselves Renato Pasopiani and Tania Copechi, young Italian artists whose medium is the Internet, want you to know much more about them than what can be deduced from the musical selections on their computer.\n  choice: In fact, they have such an immense archive\n  choice: \"This one thing we do has so many things attached to it,\" says Pasopiani, 25, in a French-Italian cafe near his home in Rome.\n  choice: The music files stored on a computer can reveal a lot about its owner.\n  choice: A hard disk full of Eminem songs might indicate a rebellious teenager, while several albums' worth of 'N Sync tunes might suggest a listener with a slightly more romantic outlook.\n  choice: it's not clear how they store their own music online at all.\n  choice: But most of the CDs aren't even legally released for sale, Pasopiani explains, because each copy sells for $1,500 or more and is reserved only for record stores.\n  choice: As I try to get a handle on where exactly all these musical pieces are coming from (the answer is: everywhere), he takes me into a warehouse where racks upon racks of CD cases hold music by American rappers like Dr Dre and Eminem as well as groups like KISS.\n  choice: So if someone buys two copies of Eminem's 2001 single \"Sing For The Moment\" in Italy, for example, they're simply reselling him back to the company, which then recycles the discs into more albums.\nFIRST COMPUTER-GENERATED SENTENCE:","targets":["They've built a website that lets anyone access their digital music library\u2014an enormous collection that spans decades and many continents."],"multiple_choice_targets":["The music files stored on a computer can reveal a lot about its owner.","A hard disk full of Eminem songs might indicate a rebellious teenager, while several albums' worth of 'N Sync tunes might suggest a listener with a slightly more romantic outlook.","A couple who call themselves Renato Pasopiani and Tania Copechi, young Italian artists whose medium is the Internet, want you to know much more about them than what can be deduced from the musical selections on their computer.","They've built a website that lets anyone access their digital music library\u2014an enormous collection that spans decades and many continents.","In fact, they have such an immense archive","it's not clear how they store their own music online at all.","\"This one thing we do has so many things attached to it,\" says Pasopiani, 25, in a French-Italian cafe near his home in Rome.","As I try to get a handle on where exactly all these musical pieces are coming from (the answer is: everywhere), he takes me into a warehouse where racks upon racks of CD cases hold music by American rappers like Dr Dre and Eminem as well as groups like KISS.","But most of the CDs aren't even legally released for sale, Pasopiani explains, because each copy sells for $1,500 or more and is reserved only for record stores.","So if someone buys two copies of Eminem's 2001 single \"Sing For The Moment\" in Italy, for example, they're simply reselling him back to the company, which then recycles the discs into more albums."],"multiple_choice_scores":[0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0],"idx":2155,"is_generated":false,"true_idx":6588},{"inputs":"You will be presented with a document containing 10 sentences.

She has even seen his passion manifested in unusual locales like Florida.

Seven years later, Phil Kessel has blossomed into one of hockey's top prospects. He is blessed with the kind of speed that has prompted several professional scouts to compare him to Pavel Bure, who starred for the Vancouver Canucks and the Florida Panthers before finishing his career with the Rangers in 2002-3.

Giuliani has ordered most New York City agencies to cut spending by 1 percent immediately. And to insure that he wrestles spending under control, Mr. Giuliani has imposed what he called \"a strict monitoring system\" that requires agency heads whose spending goes over budget to meet with the budget director, Abraham M. Lackman, or Deputy Mayor Peter J. Powers to explain why. Anyone whose agency's spending rises more than 2 percent will have to explain the reasons to the Mayor himself. The spending reductions -- ordered by Mr. Giuliani in a letter on Wednesday to each of the city's commissioners and directors of other agencies -- will pare $75 million from the current budget, which ends in June, Mr. Lackman said. The mayor is also proposing to impose new fees for certain services. For example, a taxi driver who does not pick up passengers within 30 minutes after they call would be charged $1 per minute; a bus rider who waits longer than five minutes for a ride would pay $3.50. Mr. Giuliani, a Republican, had promised during his campaign last fall to bring down the city's deficit by cutting spending. But the plan he announced this week was much more aggressive than many expected. He proposed eliminating about $500 million in waste and duplication in government programs, including the police department, fire department and sanitation department. He also wants to eliminate the Department of Correction's $7 billion annual budget, which includes $4.5 billion for prisons and $1.8 billion for jails.\n  choice: The mayor is also proposing to impose new fees for certain services.\n  choice: Anyone whose agency's spending rises more than 2 percent will have to explain the reasons to the Mayor himself.\n  choice: He also wants to eliminate the Department of Correction's $7 billion annual budget, which includes $4.5 billion for prisons and $1.8 billion for jails.\n  choice: And to insure that he wrestles spending under control, Mr. Giuliani has imposed what he called \"a strict monitoring system\" that requires agency heads whose spending goes over budget to meet with the budget director, Abraham M.

But when the same Robert Mosbacher, since designated as chairman of the 1992 Bush re-election campaign, won't give Congress the correction data, that's raw politics. Rejecting the adjustment was unfortunate because most professionals agreed that present statistical methods could make the population count more accurate and fair. Barbara Everitt Bryant, the Census Director, told the Secretary that not adjusting amounted to \"denying that these five million persons exist.\" Yet unless a lawsuit proves otherwise, Mr. Mosbacher acted initially within his undoubted authority. He has the right to overrule his experts and demand the strongest proof that any adjustment technique is highly reliable.

It would clean the water as it flowed in and out from the source; it provided an artificial pool for our little group of children to swim; it provided protection against predators like raccoons and coyotes, which were common at this time of year; and when I became quite a young adult, it allowed me and my family to bathe comfortably without fear of running into the street to reach the bathroom door. However, over time, my parents began to notice some negative effects from using the water that surrounded us: The rocks around the stream started to be coated with brown, sticky substances. We had to regularly rinse our hands thoroughly before eating, or we'd accidentally ingest enough wet sand to turn black and lose any and all color from our skin. My younger brother developed acute gastroenteritis, and soon thereafter, his mother noticed he couldn't stop vomiting after eating. And on a more frequent basis, we found ourselves rushing down the street, terrified of stepping into the water because of the silt. Eventually, I and my friends learned that what these people saw as \"fun\" had become a dangerous practice \u2013 one that could potentially harm everyone who went swimming in their yards. So how did a game like this get turned into something so harmful? Well, this type of activity is called river-dwelling and began gaining popularity through folkloric practices back in the 1700s. At first, it consisted of individuals fishing for fish from ponds that ran alongside rivers, but then in the 1800s, authorities began to regulate this practice by prohibiting those who lived within 1 mile of a river from entering them to take part in such activities.\n  choice: We had to regularly rinse our hands thoroughly before eating, or we'd accidentally ingest enough wet sand to turn black and lose any and all color from our skin.\n  choice: At first, it consisted of individuals fishing for fish from ponds that ran alongside rivers, but then in the 1800s, authorities began to regulate this practice by prohibiting those who lived within 1 mile of a river from entering them to take part in such activities.\n  choice: It would clean the water as it flowed in and out from the source; it provided an artificial pool for our little group of children to swim; it provided protection against predators like raccoons and coyotes, which were common at this time of year; and when I became quite a young adult, it allowed me and my family to bathe comfortably without fear of running into the street to reach the bathroom door.\n  choice: And on a more frequent basis, we found ourselves rushing down the street, terrified of stepping into the water because of the silt.\n  choice: So how did a game like this get turned into something so harmful?\n  choice: Eventually, I and my friends learned that what these people saw as \"fun\" had become a dangerous practice \u2013 one that could potentially harm everyone who went swimming in their yards.\n  choice: Well, this type of activity is called river-dwelling and began gaining popularity through folkloric practices back in the 1700s.\n  choice: In the backyard of my childhood, there was a stream that served many purposes.\n  choice: However, over time, my parents began to notice some negative effects from using the water that surrounded us: The rocks around the stream started to be coated with brown, sticky substances.\n  choice: My younger brother developed acute gastroenteritis, and soon thereafter, his mother noticed he couldn't stop vomiting after eating.\nFIRST COMPUTER-GENERATED SENTENCE:","targets":["It would clean the water as it flowed in and out from the source; it provided an artificial pool for our little group of children to swim; it provided protection against predators like raccoons and coyotes, which were common at this time of year; and when I became quite a young adult, it allowed me and my family to bathe comfortably without fear of running into the street to reach the bathroom door."],"multiple_choice_targets":["In the backyard of my childhood, there was a stream that served many purposes.","It would clean the water as it flowed in and out from the source; it provided an artificial pool for our little group of children to swim; it provided protection against predators like raccoons and coyotes, which were common at this time of year; and when I became quite a young adult, it allowed me and my family to bathe comfortably without fear of running into the street to reach the bathroom door.","However, over time, my parents began to notice some negative effects from using the water that surrounded us: The rocks around the stream started to be coated with brown, sticky substances.","We had to regularly rinse our hands thoroughly before eating, or we'd accidentally ingest enough wet sand to turn black and lose any and all color from our skin.","My younger brother developed acute gastroenteritis, and soon thereafter, his mother noticed he couldn't stop vomiting after eating.","And on a more frequent basis, we found ourselves rushing down the street, terrified of stepping into the water because of the silt.","Eventually, I and my friends learned that what these people saw as \"fun\" had become a dangerous practice \u2013 one that could potentially harm everyone who went swimming in their yards.","So how did a game like this get turned into something so harmful?","Well, this type of activity is called river-dwelling and began gaining popularity through folkloric practices back in the 1700s.","At first, it consisted of individuals fishing for fish from ponds that ran alongside rivers, but then in the 1800s, authorities began to regulate this practice by prohibiting those who lived within 1 mile of a river from entering them to take part in such activities."],"multiple_choice_scores":[0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"idx":4132,"is_generated":false,"true_idx":8565},{"inputs":"You will be presented with a document containing 10 sentences.

The president sat at the end of the polished cherry piece surrounded by his own Chief of Staff and the chief of every intelligence agency in the country. For years the United States had made itself the \"world police,\" the country that stepped into everyone's problems whether they were invited or not. Today, they planned to \"fix it\" once and for all. To say that there was power at this table was an understatement; the world sat at this table, death sat in this table.

Mr. Warnke charges that national security experts like Richard Nixon, Henry Kissinger and Brent Scowcroft are objecting to a ''double-zero'' nuclear forces reduction agreement because, in the words of the ''Dr. Strangelove'' movie sub-title, they have ''stopped worrying and learned to love the bomb.'' Mr. Warnke apparently sees salvation in a double-zero agreement - in which the United States and Soviet Union would dismantle all intermediate and shorter-range nuclear missiles - despite grave warnings about the implications for Western security. Among those sounding the alarm is Gen. Bernard Rogers, former Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, who has stated that ''removing the land-based intermediate-range nuclear forces now would return NATO to its weak, pre-1979 posture.'' Before 1979, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization had no capability to deter a Soviet-Warsaw Pact conventional attack on Europe with the threat of swift, accurate attacks on key targets in the Soviet Union. According to General Rogers, this situation improved dramatically in 1983 with the deployment in West Germany of ''the very weapon most feared by the Soviet Union - the Pershing II.'' A ''double zero'' intermediate-range-missiles accord would mean relinquishing the Pershing II and with it the ability credibly to deter Soviet-Warsaw Pact aggression. Mr. Warnke contends that 325,000 United States servicemen will somehow deter a Soviet-Warsaw Pact conventional attack after an intermediate nuclear forces agreement is consummated.
