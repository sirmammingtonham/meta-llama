In today\u2019s dollars it would have cost $500 million dollars, more than any bridge built since!  \n\nJoseph Strauss headed the project.  He innovated the use of movable safety netting beneath the construction site, which saved the lives of many otherwise-unprotected ironworkers. Of eleven men killed from falls during the three-year construction period, ten were killed on a single day, when the bridge was near completion and the net failed under the stress of a scaffold that had fallen.  Nineteen others who were saved by the net over the course of construction became members of the \u201cStraight Outta Hell\u201d Club.  Strauss also included a brick from his alma mater, the University of Cincinnati, within the structure of the bridge to pay homage to the contributions of the working man and the importance of education and progress.\n\nInterestingly though, a relatively unknown residential architect named Ellen Morrow designed the overall shape of the bridge towers, the lighting scheme, and tower decorations, streetlights, railings, and walkways. The famous color was her personal selection, winning out over other possibilities, including the US Navy's suggestion that it be painted with black and yellow stripes to ensure visibility by passing ships.  \n\nFortunately, the project head Strauss was an extremely generous collaborator, and he gave credit -- some say too much credit -- to others for their work on the project.  So designers and engineers like Leon Moisseiff, Charles Alton Ellis, and Ellen Morrow are now world-famous for their part in building the most beautiful bridge ever built by the hand of man.  Strauss also frequently encouraged San Franciscans to applaud the work of the laborers who actually made the bridge possible.\n\nAssistant:  Some of it seems reasonable, but I think the comparisons to the cost of other bridges, and some of the comments on Strauss aren\u2019t correct.  There may also be some other factual errors.\n\nHuman:  I\u2019m actually writing this as a note for my daughter\u2019s class before her field trip to the bridge.
