[{"inputs":"Question: Which phrase best fits the <MASK> span? Context: \nA: Tiffany, why are more and more people turning to the Web to find a mate? \nB: I think that, as more people use the Internet for both work and pleasure, it makes more sense as a tool to connect with people, and the stigma of meeting someone online is reduced. \nA: There are actually special sites for people looking to date within their specific ethnic group and age group. But how should you screen potential mates? Do you suggest talking to them on the phone right away or communicating via e-mail? \nB: I would say do not make the e-mail exchange too long. A lot of times a connection via e-mail creates almost a false sense of intimacy. Quickly make sure there is a connection in the physical world. \nA: Can you give us any other safety tips for people pursuing relationships on the Net? \nB: I'd suggest you not give out too much personal information, like your home address, until after several dates. Just keep up the same guards you would keep up if you were meeting any stranger. \nA: Besides the growth of these matchmaker sites, do you have any stats on success rates?

Every day, I wake up and head straight for the shower. Every second day, I wash my hair. If it's a hair-washing day, I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily. Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too. Because my hair is so long, I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes. Afterwards, I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew. I take a long time to get dressed in the morning. Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before, but usually I do it in the morning. In all, getting dressed takes about half an hour, at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair. From time to time I'll put my hair up, but oftentimes I bloody it straight.
