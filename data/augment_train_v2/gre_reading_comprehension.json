[{"inputs": "Q: The following passage is excerpted from an article about the potential benefits and drawbacks of using genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in agriculture.The debate over the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in agriculture has raged for decades, with proponents touting the potential benefits of increased yields and resistance to pests and disease, and opponents cautioning against potential environmental and health risks. A recent study published in the journal Environmental Science & Technology attempted to shed light on these risks by examining the potential effects of GMOs on non-target insects, such as bees and butterflies. The study found that while genetically modified crops did not have a significant impact on non-target insects when compared to conventional crops, the pesticides often used in conjunction with GMOs did have negative effects. Specifically, the study found that neonicotinoid pesticides, commonly used on genetically modified crops, were highly toxic to bees and other beneficial insects. These findings raise concerns about the long-term impact of GMOs on non-target insect populations, and highlight the need for continued research into the potential risks and benefits of genetically modified crops.Which of the following statements is best supported by the information presented in the passage?\n  choice: The use of GMOs in agriculture has no negative impact on non-target insects.\n  choice: Neonicotinoid pesticides are more harmful to non-target insects than other types of pesticides.\n  choice: The potential risks and benefits of GMOs in agriculture require further research.\n  choice: Genetically modified crops have been shown to significantly increase yields and resistance to pests and disease.\nA:", "targets": ["The potential risks and benefits of GMOs in agriculture require further research."], "multiple_choice_targets": ["The use of GMOs in agriculture has no negative impact on non-target insects.", "Neonicotinoid pesticides are more harmful to non-target insects than other types of pesticides.", "The potential risks and benefits of GMOs in agriculture require further research.", "Genetically modified crops have been shown to significantly increase yields and resistance to pests and disease."]}, {"inputs": "Q: The following passage is excerpted from a book about the history of the American Revolution.In the early years of the Revolutionary War, the American army was plagued by a shortage of gunpowder. Much of the gunpowder used by the Continental Army was imported from overseas, and supplies were often disrupted by British naval blockades. To address this problem, the Continental Congress authorized the creation of a national armory in Springfield, Massachusetts. The Springfield Armory, as it came to be known, was responsible for producing most of the gunpowder used by the Continental Army throughout the rest of the war. The armory was also involved in the production of weapons, including muskets and rifles, and played an important role in supplying the American troops with the arms they needed to fight the British. Today, the Springfield Armory is a National Historic Site that commemorates this important chapter in American history.Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?\n  choice: The British navy was responsible for disrupting the supply of gunpowder to the Continental Army.\n  choice: The Springfield Armory was created in response to a shortage of guns in the American army.\n  choice: The Springfield Armory produced all of the weapons used by the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War.\n  choice: The Springfield Armory played an important role in helping the American army win the Revolutionary War.\nA:", "targets": ["The Springfield Armory played an important role in supplying the American troops with the arms they needed to fight the British."], "multiple_choice_targets": ["The British navy was responsible for disrupting the supply of gunpowder to the Continental Army.", "The Springfield Armory was created in response to a shortage of guns in the American army.", "The Springfield Armory produced all of the weapons used by the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War.", "The Springfield Armory played an important role in helping the American army win the Revolutionary War."]}, {"inputs": "Q: A study conducted by a team of researchers at Harvard Medical School found that women who consumed more than three servings of blueberries and strawberries per week had a lower risk of heart attack than women who consumed less of these fruits.

In a market economy, prices are determined by supply and demand. When the supply of a product exceeds the demand, the price of the product will typically fall, as producers compete with each other to sell their goods. Conversely, when the demand for a product exceeds the supply, the price of the product will typically rise, as consumers compete with each other to purchase the available goods. This system of price determination helps to allocate resources efficiently, as producers are incentivized to produce goods that are in high demand, while consumers are incentivized to purchase goods that are in low supply.

The American Revolution was a major turning point in the history of the United States. Prior to the revolution, the American colonies were under the control of Great Britain and had little autonomy or representation in government. However, the colonists grew increasingly dissatisfied with British rule, particularly with regards to taxation without representation and other policies that they felt infringed upon their rights as Englishmen. In 1776, the Continental Congress declared independence from Great Britain, and the revolutionary war ensued. The war was long and difficult, but ultimately resulted in American victory and the establishment of a new nation based on principles of democracy and individual liberty.

Carbon dioxide is a colorless, odorless gas that is naturally present in the earth\u2019s atmosphere. However, human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation have caused a significant increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels over the past century. This increase is contributing to climate change by trapping heat in the atmosphere and causing global temperatures to rise. While some carbon dioxide is absorbed by plants and the ocean, these natural sinks are unable to keep up with the current rate of emissions. As a result, it is essential that we take action to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and limit the amount of carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere. Which of the following statements is best supported by the information presented in the passage?\n  choice: Carbon dioxide is not naturally present in the earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n  choice: Human activities have had no impact on atmospheric carbon dioxide levels.\n  choice: Increased atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are contributing to climate change.\n  choice: Plants and the ocean can absorb all of the carbon dioxide produced by human activities.\nA:", "targets": ["Increased atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are contributing to climate change."], "multiple_choice_targets": ["Carbon dioxide is not naturally present in the earth\u2019s atmosphere.", "Human activities have had no impact on atmospheric carbon dioxide levels.", "Increased atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are contributing to climate change.", "Plants and the ocean can absorb all of the carbon dioxide produced by human activities."]}]
