In terms of overall impact, the International Monetary Fund concluded that it was the worst global recession since World War II. The causes of the recession largely originated in the United States, particularly related to the real estate market, though policies of other nations contributed as well. It led to the failure of large financial institutions, the bailout of banks by national governments, and downturns in stock markets around the world. In many areas, the housing market also suffered, resulting in evictions, foreclosures and prolonged unemployment. It contributed to the failure of key businesses, declines in consumer wealth estimated in trillions of US dollars, and a significant decline in economic activity, leading to a severe global economic recession.\n  choice: What was the Great Recession?\n  choice: In what year did the Great Recession occur?\nChoose the appropriate question which has the given answer.", "targets": ["In what year did the Great Recession occur?"], "multiple_choice_targets": ["What was the Great Recession?", "In what year did the Great Recession occur?"]}, {"inputs": "Given a short answer along with its context, select the most appropriate question which has the given short answer as its answer.\n\nHere is the short answer followed by the context.\nShort Answer: 1962 Context: The Cuban Missile Crisis, also known as the October Crisis of 1962, the Caribbean Crisis (Russian: \u041a\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0431\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u0440\u0438\u0437\u0438\u0441, tr.
