She always played with him, held him when there was a storm outside, and fed him the good stuff off the dinner table. She was a wonderful dog to have around, she would run up to you and give you kisses, but if you didn't return them, she'd bite your hand or paw until you did. She loved to play fetch with her master and even after he died, she still followed his scent all over the house. I'm not sure how much of this is true, but I do know that it's a very sad story. Jenny lived in my home for about 8 years before she passed away. Her death came as a shock to me because I never thought anything like this could happen to a dog. Her body was found by my brother-in-law who happened to be walking through our neighborhood on his way to work. He called us immediately and we rushed to the scene.

Opinion polls suggest that Vojislav Kostunica, a conservative nationalist and currently president of the Yugoslav federation grouping Serbia and Montenegro, will pick up two-thirds of the vote to defeat two more radical nationalist candidates. But unless more than half of the electorate votes the result will be annulled -- as it was in October when Mr. Kostunica won a runoff against Miroljub Labus, a pro-Western liberal, by a similar margin. Serbia needs a new president to replace Milan Milutinovic, an associate of the ousted Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic. He faces trial on war crimes charges once his term expires at the end of the month. If a successor is not elected, the speaker of Parliament would take over temporarily under the old Constitution, which would then most likely be amended so parliamentary deputies can choose the new president. The likely failure of Sunday's vote is the result of a long-running feud between Mr. Kostunica and the Serbian prime minister, Zoran Djindjic. The two forged a reformist alliance to topple Mr. Milosevic two years ago but have since refused to cooperate, derailing the reform process. The sacking of Croatia's Prime Minister Ivo Sanader last week underscores tensions. On Sunday Mr. Djurdjic used nationalist rhetoric against Croatian leaders who he accused of supporting asylum seekers who seek to enter Serbia illegally from neighboring countries.\n  choice: The sacking of Croatia's Prime Minister Ivo Sanader last week underscores tensions.\n  choice: He faces trial on war crimes charges once his term expires at the end of the month.\n  choice: Opinion polls suggest that Vojislav Kostunica, a conservative nationalist and currently president of the Yugoslav federation grouping Serbia and Montenegro, will pick up two-thirds of the vote to defeat two more radical nationalist candidates.\n  choice: But unless more than half of the electorate votes the result will be annulled -- as it was in October when Mr. Kostunica won a runoff against Miroljub Labus, a pro-Western liberal, by a similar margin.\n  choice: The likely failure of Sunday's vote is the result of a long-running feud between Mr. Kostunica and the Serbian prime minister, Zoran Djindjic.\n  choice: If a successor is not elected, the speaker of Parliament would take over temporarily under the old Constitution, which would then most likely be amended so parliamentary deputies can choose the new president.\n  choice: The two forged a reformist alliance to topple Mr. Milosevic two years ago but have since refused to cooperate, derailing the reform process.\n  choice: On Sunday, Serbia will make its third attempt this year to elect a new president, but disillusionment with political infighting is so intense that low voter turnout could once again invalidate the ballot.\n  choice: On Sunday Mr. Djurdjic used nationalist rhetoric against Croatian leaders who he accused of supporting asylum seekers who seek to enter Serbia illegally from neighboring countries.\n  choice: Serbia needs a new president to replace Milan Milutinovic, an associate of the ousted Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic.\nFIRST COMPUTER-GENERATED SENTENCE:","targets":["The sacking of Croatia's Prime Minister Ivo Sanader last week underscores tensions."],"multiple_choice_targets":["On Sunday, Serbia will make its third attempt this year to elect a new president, but disillusionment with political infighting is so intense that low voter turnout could once again invalidate the ballot.","Opinion polls suggest that Vojislav Kostunica, a conservative nationalist and currently president of the Yugoslav federation grouping Serbia and Montenegro, will pick up two-thirds of the vote to defeat two more radical nationalist candidates.","But unless more than half of the electorate votes the result will be annulled -- as it was in October when Mr. Kostunica won a runoff against Miroljub Labus, a pro-Western liberal, by a similar margin.","Serbia needs a new president to replace Milan Milutinovic, an associate of the ousted Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic.","He faces trial on war crimes charges once his term expires at the end of the month.","If a successor is not elected, the speaker of Parliament would take over temporarily under the old Constitution, which would then most likely be amended so parliamentary deputies can choose the new president.","The likely failure of Sunday's vote is the result of a long-running feud between Mr. Kostunica and the Serbian prime minister, Zoran Djindjic.","The two forged a reformist alliance to topple Mr. Milosevic two years ago but have since refused to cooperate, derailing the reform process.","The sacking of Croatia's Prime Minister Ivo Sanader last week underscores tensions.","On Sunday Mr. Djurdjic used nationalist rhetoric against Croatian leaders who he accused of supporting asylum seekers who seek to enter Serbia illegally from neighboring countries."],"multiple_choice_scores":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0],"idx":5603,"is_generated":false,"true_idx":10036}]
