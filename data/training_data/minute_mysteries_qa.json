[{"inputs":"Story: Special Agent-in-charge Sam Connors looked over the four men standing before him in the pouring rain. Their grim faces were lit up by the jagged lightning that streaked through the sullen sky, their bodies trembling with the rolling thunder that shook the earth all around. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get Pee Wee Galento for sure this time,\u201d the big FBI man growled. \u201cDead or alive!\u201d The men nodded, fedoras dripping. They climbed into the rumbling Ford Model A, Connors behind the wheel and drove off into the storm-wrenched night. The tip had come from an old prospector who\u2019d been digging for gold up in the mountains: a man was holed up in an abandoned mining shack on the edge of Splithead Canyon. The prospector had identified the man as Pee Wee Galento from the FBI Most Wanted poster he\u2019d been shown. The men sat in silence as the car roared along the deserted high Colorado road, listening to the monotonous flapping of the windshield wipers against the windscreen. The surrounding rugged countryside was shrouded in liquid darkness, except when a crashing thunderbolt tore the heavens apart. Pee Wee Galento had knocked over eight banks and gunned down three guards during his five-month crime spree. He\u2019d vowed never to be taken alive. Joe Franklin dug around in the front of his suit jacket; his hand brushing the butt of his .32 revolver nestled in its shoulder harness. He found his pack of cigarettes, shook a coffin nail out and offered it to Chester Morris sitting next to him in the backseat of the car. Chester shook his head, said, \u201cDon\u2019t smoke,\u201d his knuckles white on the barrel of the shotgun cradled between his legs. \u201cThese young guys are all into clean livin\u2019 now, huh, Sam?\u201d Joe remarked. He nervously plugged the cancer stick back into the pack and put the pack back into his suit pocket. \u201cHow many years you been in law enforcement, anyway, pops?\u201d Big George Ratcliffe asked the third man in the backseat. Joe snorted. \u201cPops! I\u2019m retiring at the end of the year, as a matter of fact \u2026 sonny. Me and the wife are all set for the easy life \u2013 just bought a cottage on Lake Avery.\u201d \u201cNot bad, old-timer,\u201d Slim Jameson commented, turning around in the front seat. \u201cMe, I got some things to take care of before I turn in my badge.\u201d He patted his left breast where his .32 was holstered. \u201cLike Pee Wee Galento, for one.\u201d \u201cPlus, you don\u2019t have the dough to live on Easy Street like Joe does,\u201d Big George said, balancing a Thompson submachine gun on his plump knees. \u201cPlayin\u2019 the ponies like you do.\u201d Slim grimaced. \u201cYeah, I got a few debts to pay off, fat guy. But who don\u2019t these days \u2013 with the Depression and all?\u201d Big George grunted. \u201cTell me about it. The bank the missus and I have been dealing at for the past five years just went under. Taking all our dough with it. And us with four kids to feed!\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t you guys shut up already!\u201d Chester rasped. This was his first manhunt. Sam Connors glanced in the rearview mirror at the pale-faced young man in the back. \u201cEasy, son,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re all in this together. We\u2019ll get our man.\u201d Twenty miles on, they turned off the highway and onto a rutted trail that wound up the side of a mountain. Another hour of bone-jarring, rain-lashed driving brought them to within a hundred yards of the shack perched on the edge of Splithead Canyon. Light leaked out from around the edges of the shade-drawn front window of the shack, smoke from the stovepipe up on the roof. \u201cBig George,\u201d Sam Connors said, \u201cyou go around and cover the back in case Pee Wee decides to bust out a window and take a tumble into the canyon. The rest of us are going through the door.\u201d The men piled out of the car and plodded forward. A bolt of lightning flashed and crackled almost directly over their heads, thunder exploding a split-second later. Sam Connors cocked his big, black .45 automatic at the door of the shack. He nodded at his men, then reared back and slammed his huge shoulder into the flimsy plank door. \u201cPut \u2018em up, Pee Wee!\u201d he roared. \u201cIt\u2019s the end of the line!\u201d The bank robber leapt out of the chair he\u2019d been dozing in, knocking over a table. A bottle and a tin plate crashed to the plank wood floor of the shack, along with stacks and stacks of stolen money \u2013 and the Tommy gun Pee Wee had employed to get the loot. He stared at the FBI agents, dazed and unbelieving. Then the lantern hanging overhead suddenly shattered, shot out, plunging the shack into darkness. Gunfire erupted like the thunder all around, muzzles blazing flame, wood splintering and glass shattering and men screaming amidst the hail of hot lead that seemed to pour from every direction. Chester lit the lantern he\u2019d been told to bring with him and tossed it inside the shack, illuminating the carnage. The blasting ceased. The silence was deafening, acrid gunsmoke hanging heavy in the air. The men stared at the bullet-ridden body of Pee Wee Galento slumped over against the far wall of the shack and at the crisp green money scattered all over the floor. \u201cI got a slug in the gut,\u201d Joe grimaced from beside Sam Connors. \u201cI took one in the shoulder myself,\u201d the Special Agent-in-charge replied, fingering the small hole in his trench coat. \u201cI think a bullet winged my ear chief!\u201d Big George yelled from the broken back window of the shack. \u201cBut I\u2019m okay.\u201d He was still outside the shack, but his machine gun lay inside on the floor. \u201cI guess I dropped my Tommy in all the excitement,\u201d the agent sheepishly admitted. Sam Connors looked at Slim crouched in a shooting position along the side-wall. \u201cWhat about you, Slim?\u201d \u201cI think I got a chunk taken out of my thigh. But that don\u2019t matter. We got the crumb,\u201d he gritted, glaring at Pee Wee\u2019s lifeless body, \u201cthat\u2019s all that matters.\u201d Sam Connors glanced behind him. \u201cYou can come in now, Chester.\u201d The young FBI man slunk into the room, clutching his shotgun. \u201cI was, um, just keeping the front door covered \u2013 in case Pee Wee broke through you guys.\u201d Sam Connors grunted, nodding at the bank robber\u2019s gleaming black machine gun lying on the floor. \u201cWe got a lot of men shot, and shot at \u2026 considering.\u201d \u201cConsidering what?\u201d Joe groaned, holding his stomach. \u201cConsidering Pee Wee Galento never fired a single shot.\u201d The FBI special agent grimly regarded his men, his .45 level and cocked. \u201cLooks to me like someone else was after this bank loot besides Pee Wee. And I think I know who.\u201d Who stole the loot?\nAnswer:","targets":["\u201cWhat!? Who?\u201d Joe gasped. \u201cWho\u2019s the dirty rat who\u2019d ambush his own colleagues?\u201d\n\nSam Connors pointed his big gun at Slim. \u201cDrop the heater, Jameson,\u201d he ordered. \u201cYou\u2019re not getting the loot \u2013 over any of our dead bodies.\u201d\n\nChester swung his shotgun around on Slim, backing up his boss. \u201cWhy Slim?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cIt figures. Joe and I were both hit by single bullets, not a shotgun blast. And not two or three chunks of lead in a row, like from a machine gun. That lets you and Big George out. Not to mention, you weren\u2019t even in the room, and Big George dropped his chopper \u2026 in all the excitement.\u201d\n\nSlim\u2019s hatchet face went white as lightning. \u201cIt-It coulda been Joe!\u201d he squealed. \u201cYeah, he just shot himself to cover up!\u201d\n\n\u201cLike you said you\u2019re shot \u2013 to cover up? Sure, it could\u2019ve been Joe. Only Joe doesn\u2019t need the money. He and his wife just bought a cottage on Lake Avery, or didn\u2019t you hear?\u201d Sam Connors steely grey eyes narrowed, his blunt finger tightening on the trigger of his gun. \u201cBut you needed the money, Slim. To pay off all those gambling debts of yours.\u201d\n\nSlim\u2019s smoking .32 had been hanging down at his side. And now it suddenly jerked up.\n\nBut the slim man wasn\u2019t fast enough.

Today, with the Jackdaw becalmed and wallowing in the Atlantic swell, the noise was deafening. Elijah Fairfax hastened up the companionway to the quarterdeck. \u201cCaptain?\u201d \u201cSomeone has broken the Code,\u201d Roberts pointed into the cabin of the recently-captured Jackdaw. \u201cOne of those scurvy dogs stole for themselves. Ye know the rules. You steal from one, you steal from all. Root out this vile dog. Root him out, and I\u2019ll make him pay.\u201d Fairfax stepped into the cabin that once belonged to the captain of the Jackdaw. This captain and his crew were to be sold as slaves in Whydah, and his sloop would become the latest addition to Robert\u2019s pirate fleet. After the blazing heat of the equatorial sun, the cabin was dark and cool. Fairfax stood on the threshold, letting his eyes adjust. There was not much to see: a cot, a table and chair to port. To starboard, a chest and a row of shelves with fiddles to stop the contents from sliding around in rough seas. On the chest stood a small casket, its lock prised open and its interior empty and bare. \u201cPieces of eight!\u201d Fairfax jumped and swore when he cracked his head on the low beams. He reached for the cutlass at his side, eyes searching the source of the cry. He relaxed when he saw an African Grey parrot perched near the head of the cot, which was quite a prize. A talking parrot could fetch a pretty penny in the markets. A strange scent caught his attention. Orange blossom? This far from shore? He wrinkled his nose, turning his head from side to side. There. By the casket. White powder on the floor. And there, scuffed in the dust, a pair of boot prints. Fairfax turned and went back outside. Roberts was pacing the quarterdeck, his dark brows furrowed. The crew busied themselves in the waist, out of earshot of the quarterdeck, desperate to avoid catching the captain\u2019s eye when he was in one of his black moods. \u201cWell, have ye found \u2018em yet,\u201d he snapped. \u201cNot yet,\u201d said Fairfax. \u201cDo you know what was in the casket?\u201d \u201cOf course I know. A necklace of diamonds and rubies. Lots of them. And two earrings to match. Made by the very jeweler to Queen Anne herself. Worth a king\u2019s ransom. The fool tried to buy his freedom with those jewels.\u201d Roberts shook his head, \u201cAs if we wouldn\u2019t just take what we want anyway.\u201d \u201cAnd when did you last see them?\u201d asked Fairfax. \u201cJust before I rowed back to the Ranger,\u201d said Roberts. \u201cThat was about two hours ago. And in that time, someone\u2019s been a-thievin\u2019. Find out who went into the cabin, and who stole the necklace, Quartermaster. And do it quickly. I ain\u2019t a patient man!\u201d Rapid enquiries amongst the fearful crew revealed that four men had been in the cabin in the captain\u2019s absence. Fairfax sat in the chair in the captain\u2019s cabin and called them in one by one. \u201cI ain\u2019t no thief,\u201d said Mr Arbuthnot, the ship\u2019s carpenter. \u201cI came in \u2018ere to check for structural damage from the dustup, so I did. And when I ain\u2019t found none, I left.\u201d \u201cAnd yet the casket was broken into and a necklace stolen,\u201d said Fairfax. \u201cChild\u2019s play for a man with your skills. And tools.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m tellin\u2019 you, it weren\u2019t me,\u201d bridled Arbuthnot. A shrill squawk rent the air. \u201cPretty necklace. Pretty necklace.\u201d Both men glanced at the African parrot. \u201cMine. Mine.\u201d \u201cWill that be all?\u201d asked the carpenter. Fairfax nodded and Arbuthnot levered himself out of the chair and stepped out of the cabin, his wooden leg thumping on the deck with each step. A timid boy, barely fourteen-years-old, took his place. \u201cWhat were you doing in this cabin, Will?\u201d \u201cLooking for new shirts for the captain, Mr Fairfax, sir.\u201d Will held his neckerchief in his hands and twisted it. \u201cI done nothing wrong.\u201d \u201cNew shirts?\u201d \u201cAye,\" said Will. \u201cThe captain, he keeps getting sword cuts in his good silk shirts. I was looking to see if there were any here.\u201d \u201cAnd did you find any?\u201d \u201cNo sir. The captain came back, yelled at me to hurry up or I\u2019d miss the boat back to the Ranger. Startled me something awful, he did.\u201d \u201cAnd after he startled you, what did you do then?\u201d \u201cWent straight out the door just behind the captain,\u201d said Will. \u201cIt ain't wise to keep the captain waiting.\u201d \u201cSo you didn\u2019t steal the necklace?\u201d \u201cOh no sir. I\u2019m a pirate,\u201d said the boy, his chest puffed out. \u201cI would never break the Code.\u201d Feeling thoroughly confused, Fairfax waved Will out of the office. Will ushered in Nehemiah, assistant to the ship\u2019s cook. \u201cSo Nehemiah, what were you doing in this cabin?\u201d Nehemiah didn\u2019t say a word. \u201cPlease sir, he can\u2019t speak, sir \u2013 his tongue was cut out by the Yoruba.\u201d \u201cOf course, Will. Thank you. You may go.\u201d Will left. Fairfax asked his question again. \u201cWhat were you doing in the cabin? Nehemiah mimed carrying a platter. \u201cYou were bringing the captain his dinner?\u201d Nehemiah shook his head, side to side. \u201cNo? You were clearing up after his dinner?\u201d Nehemiah nodded. The parrot squawked, \u201cPretty Polly. Pretty Polly.\u201d \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t steal the necklace?\u201d Nehemiah shook his head, and moved his hands in an emphatically negative gesture. At a loss for further questions, Fairfax ran his fingers through sun-bleached hair and waved him out of the room. \u201cElijah!\u201d boomed Bosun Ridley as he came in, stooping low under the beams. \u201cPretty mess we\u2019ve got here.\u201d \u201cYou can say that again,\u201d said Fairfax, \u201cCaptain\u2019s riled, crew\u2019s upset, all because of one rotten apple in the barrel.\u201d \u201cWell you can\u2019t think it was me, can you?\u201d laughed the bosun. \u201cSacrifice my position just for a necklace and a pair of diamond earrings? I\u2019ve got more sense.\u201d \u201cWhat were you doing in the cabin anyway,\u201d asked Fairfax. \u201cI\u2019d have thought you\u2019d have been busy re-reeving the rigging.\u201d \u201cCaptain asked me to sail this \u2018ere Jackdaw to Devil\u2019s Island for a refit. Just wanted to check if this lubberly captain carried charts and instruments. Always best to be prepared, that\u2019s my motto.\u201d \u201cSo it wasn\u2019t you.\u201d \u201cSwear on me grandma\u2019s grave, gawd bless \u2018er,\u201d said Ridley. \u201cAnything else, cos I\u2019ve got to get moving smartly if I\u2019m gonna have Jackdaw ready to sail by dark.\u201d Captain Roberts stormed in. \u201cYou found me a man to maroon yet, Fairfax?\u201d \u201cNot quite. I have one question for you. Did Will go over to the Ranger with you?\u201d \u201cAye. He\u2019s a dullard, that one. I had to come back \u2018ere to fetch him. He knocked all that powder on the floor and I had to drag \u2018im out with me to make sure he didn\u2019t get left behind.\u201d \u201cYo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum,\u201d sang the parrot. And suddenly Fairfax knew who the culprit was. Who stole the necklace?\nAnswer:","targets":["Mr Arbuthnot is innocent. He has a wooden leg and could not have left two boot prints in the wig powder on the floor.\n\nNehemiah is also innocent. The parrot repeats the burglar's satisfaction with his ill-gotten gains, and Nehemiah is mute.\n\nIt could not be Will. The captain had to hurry him out of the cabin straight after he spilled the powder, before the boot prints were left there.\n\nBosun Ridley is guilty. The parrot mimicked his satisfaction at having stolen the necklace and he had plenty of time in the cabin while searching for charts and navigation instruments. But the real giveaway is that only the captain and Fairfax knew the stolen items had included earrings. When Bosun Ridley mentioned this, he sentenced himself to being marooned on an island with nothing but a flask of water and a pistol with a single bullet."],"multiple_choice_targets":[],"multiple_choice_scores":[],"idx":177,"is_generated":false,"true_idx":177},{"inputs":"Story: Who would have thought that this intolerable job would give me the chance to show my skills as a detective? Not me! The paper is sending someone over to interview me shortly, so I\u2019ve got just enough time to tell you what happened. I\u2019m Sam Jaspers, and I work the night shift, cleaning up and washing the dishes here at the Palace Diner. Some Palace! The counters are so old that the yellow stains are permanent. The regulars would miss them if they ever got scrubbed away, my boss said. Oh yes, the boss (and chef) is Tom Greene. He has owned the place for years. Some say he won it in a crap game. If you ask me, I bet he lost the crap game, and had to take it over! But, as I was saying, I clean the place during the night shift, from 11:00 p.m. to six o\u2019clock in the morning. There\u2019s nobody here after 2:00 a.m., except the occasional trucker, or student pulling an all-nighter to study for exams. My work is really done by around 3:00 a.m., so I get to put in a couple of hours studying, too. I catch up on sleep in the afternoon, after classes. I\u2019m at the university on the top of the hill. But my \u201cscholarship\u201d comes from working at the Palace Diner! Anyway, last night Tom Greene left early. There was just one regular, Mary Ingram, in the restaurant then, around midnight I\u2019d say. The waitress on duty was Louisa Perry. Typically, after Tom leaves, she does whatever short order cooking is necessary, from a grill behind the counter. Well, last night a college student I know, John Beddington, came in to have a cup of coffee, and to fill me in on an assignment that I had missed. I was there in class, but slept through the lecture! Let\u2019s see, the only other person there wasn\u2019t a regular, but she struck up a talk with Mary, and then shared her table. She said her name was Sarah Upton. At one o\u2019clock things had calmed down considerably, so I decided to clean the rest rooms, the one chore I really hate. But it\u2019s a matter of pride to do it right. I did the men\u2019s room first. Then, as usual, I checked with Louisa, and she went into the ladies\u2019 room, opening the door and calling to make sure the room was empty. It was. Then Louisa went back to the counter, and I put my sign on the outer door, then went in and started to clean, the sinks and whatnot. Well, when I do a job, I do it carefully. So it wasn\u2019t long before I saw, hanging on a hook inside the last toilet stall on the other side of the faucets, a handbag. Actually, it looked like a tapestry bag, rather large, with colorful designs. I took a peek inside the bag. It was full of money! I didn\u2019t want to count it then and there. I was on the verge of coming out, when I remembered -- there had been an old lady earlier, who had trouble getting around. She had a walker. I remembered seeing her with that tapestry bag. Her bag was hung up on the back of her booth. Then it hit me -- it had still been there when she left! I didn\u2019t think anything of it at the time. For one thing, lost and found is not my concern. The waitresses usually take care of that sort of problem, taking possession of anything that has been lost by mistake. And I\u2019m too busy with my own chores to bother looking for new ones. But this was odd. Then I thought of something else. I hadn\u2019t remembered the old lady going to the ladies\u2019 room. Come to think of it, she couldn\u2019t have gone, even if she wanted to. There are steps that a handicapped person couldn\u2019t climb. I always thought this would get Tom Greene in big trouble, since there are public access laws in this state, but it hadn\u2019t yet. Maybe we were too small and insignificant to bother with. Or maybe the people who do the enforcing hadn\u2019t had the pleasure of real world eating at the Palace Diner! Anyway, this was an emergency, so I did what Tom always told his new employees to do (but never expected that anyone would really ever do): I got out my cell phone and called him at home. I was in luck. He wasn\u2019t asleep yet. He took it all in, thought a minute, and then asked me to count the money. I did -- it was more than one thousand dollars! There were also some family pictures in the bag, one of them of the old lady herself. And, of course, there was a name and an address. She would have no trouble getting her property back. Tom was pleased. He told me to take possession of the bag, and that he\u2019d be back at the diner inside an hour. I wrapped the tapestry bag up in some large vacuum cleaner bags that were on my cleaning cart. I unlocked my locker, got out a history book, put the tapestry bag into my locker, and went to a back table with my history book. I planned to get in some reading for class before Tom returned. When I looked around, there was Louisa at the counter, with a clear view of both rest rooms. She was doing some inventory work for the day shift, orders to be made for butter, hamburger, rolls and cheese, probably. We sell a lot of cheeseburgers during the night shift, and Tom monitors all supplies carefully. John came back to say good night, and with a yawn, said he was heading back up the hill, to his dormitory. I thanked him again for his help with the assignment. He said it was nothing, and also mentioned that we served the worst cup of coffee he\u2019d ever had! Mary Ingram finished her third cup of coffee, then went back to the ladies\u2019 room. Had I remembered? Yes, I had taken the \u201cNo Admission\u201d sign off the door. Wearing fresh makeup, Mary came out a few minutes later, said a cheery good night to Louisa and me, and left the diner. \u201cSee you again tonight,\u201d she waved. She was always there. We were, she pointed out, her family, after all. That left Sarah Upton, and I felt almost sorry for her. She clearly didn\u2019t want to leave, and seemed to have no place to go. She seemed to postpone leaving as long as she could. After Mary left she went up to the counter, but Louisa\u2019s foul mood discouraged conversation. Sarah Upton tried to pull herself and her remaining dignity together, and with a shrug of the shoulders, waved a goodbye to me, and left the diner. At that point, Tom Greene entered. He quickly came over to me. I nodded, to assure him that I had the tapestry bag, safe and sound. \u201cBut I can do better than that, Tom. I know who the thief was, too!\u201d Who is the thief?\nAnswer:","targets":["Louisa Perry, the waitress, tried to steal the bag full of money. She noticed it had been left when the old lady exited the diner. She thought the safest place to hide the bag was in the ladies\u2019 room. If it were found in her locker, there would be no defense to a larceny charge.\n\nSince she had a clear view of both rest rooms from her station, Louisa would have noticed if John Beddington had, by mistake, gone into the ladies\u2019 room.\n\nSarah Upton did not use the ladies\u2019 room before she left the diner. That eliminates her as a suspect, as she would have gone to the ladies\u2019 room to retrieve the bag had she stolen it.\n\nMary Ingram used the ladies\u2019 room before she left the diner. She freshened her makeup. However, she showed no signs of concern as she said good night to the waitress and custodian, as she would have done if she had searched in vain for the stolen handbag.\n\nOn the contrary, it was Louisa the waitress who was curt to the point of rudeness when the last customer left.

It was a hot day even for July 1st, not a cloud in the sky and that had brought out the hordes anxious to escape the nitty-gritty furnace of the city. It was only eleven in the morning, but Glen had already made a pretty good haul \u2013 $4.65 in loose change, a pair of slightly bent sunglasses, one fully functioning watch and two rings (one of which appeared to be at least 10K gold). People sometimes made fun of Glen as he scouted around with his long-handled magnetic machine, sweeping it back and forth over the ground, headphones on, listening for the beeping sound that signaled buried metal. But he looked at it this way: not only was he enriching himself to a certain extent (to supplement his meager teacher\u2019s pension) and getting some much-needed exercise, but he was also providing a community service. Because along with the valuables, he also uncovered and removed from the dirt or the sand loose can pull-tabs, bottle caps and openers, misplaced keys and other sharp metal objects which could cut unsuspecting bare feet or other body parts, if stepped on or fallen on the wrong way. Glen pushed back the floppy brim of his Tilley hat and mopped his forehead, promising himself a hot dog and cold soda for lunch with the money he\u2019d found. He was up by the entrance to the beach, and as he bent his head and machine back down, he noticed a plastic bag sticking out of the sand about ten feet to his left. Often his bespectacled eyes were just as adept as his metal-detecting machine at finding treasure, and such was the case here. Because as Glen bent down and pulled the sealed plastic sandwich bag out of the sand, he saw that it contained money \u2013 lots of it, in bills and coins. He grinned, eyes lighting up like a slot machine that\u2019s hit Jackpot! Then he frowned slightly, noting that the brightly colored bills and large golden and silver coins weren\u2019t good ol\u2019 American greenbacks and change, but rather Canadian currency. Sadly, they were not legal tender in Nebraska, where Glen lived. But the money could still be exchanged at a bank for American cash (at a slight discount, given the Canadian dollar\u2019s lower value relative to the US dollar). Glen\u2019s grin went back up again, as he prepared to open the baggie and count up his loot. Suddenly, though, he was surrounded by four fellow beachgoers who\u2019d seen him pick up the moneybag. They closed in on him, loudly proclaiming the dough as their own. Glen quickly stashed the found money in his fanny pack for safekeeping and then held up his hand. \u201cHold on, folks!\u201d he addressed the two men, one woman and one child, all of whom were clad in nothing but swimsuits. \u201cWhat do you mean \u2018hold on\u2019?\u201d the stocky blonde man protested. \u201cThat\u2019s my money. It dropped out of my pants pocket on my way onto the beach. Now give it here!\u201d \u201cNot so fast, Blondie,\u201d the redheaded woman cut in. \u201cThat\u2019s my cash. I put it in the plastic baggie so I could bury it in the sand beneath my clothing \u2013 so it wouldn\u2019t get stolen when I went swimming. But I lost it on my way down to the beach.\u201d \u201cThat money\u2019s mine, mister!\u201d the tall bald man exclaimed. \u201cI keep it in a plastic baggie when I go to the beach so it doesn\u2019t get wet. I\u2019m Canadian. I\u2019d show you my passport \u2026 but I don\u2019t have it with me.\u201d He gestured at his swim trunks. \u201cI\u2019m Canadian, too,\u201d the little black-haired girl stated, looking forlornly up at Glen. \u201cMy parents and I are visiting my sick Grandmother down here. That\u2019s all the money I brought with me to buy presents for her. I put it in a plastic bag to take to the bank to change into American money.\u201d She reached for Glen\u2019s fanny pack. He took a step back, holding his metal detector up as a barrier to the avarice crowd. As a former schoolteacher, he knew a little something about the Great White North, having taught North American studies in high school for years. So, like all teachers, he felt that a pop quiz was in order, to identify the true Canuck owner of the Canadian currency. \u201cHow many provinces are there in Canada, young lady?\u201d he asked the little black-haired girl. \u201cTen,\u201d she promptly replied, smiling sweetly. \u201cAnd what\u2019s the capital city of Canada?\u201d \u201cToronto,\u201d she responded, just as confidently. Glen turned to the stocky blonde man. \u201cWhat are Canada\u2019s two official languages, sir?\u201d The man grunted and grinned. \u201cThey are English and French, of course.\u201d \u201cAnd who was the earliest European explorer to discover Canada?\u201d \u201cYou mean besides the Vikings?\u201d He scratched his chin. \u201cWell, it was, of course \u2026 Jacques Cartier.\u201d He held out a hand for the cash. Glen moved on to the tall bald man, giving nothing away. \u201cWhat\u2019s on the Canadian flag, sir?\u201d \u201cIt is a maple leaf,\u201d the man instantly answered, \u201ca red maple leaf.\u201d \u201cAnd what is the largest lake situated entirely in your country?\u201d Glen asked. The man hesitated, turning even redder than his sunburn. \u201cUh, well, that\u2019s kind of a tough one \u2026\u201d The little black-haired girl giggled. \u201cLet\u2019s see, Lake Winnipeg is quite large. And there\u2019s, uh, Great Slave Lake and Great Bear Lake, up in the Northwest Territories.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m not a hundred percent sure which is the largest.\u201d The redheaded woman snorted. \u201cHonest, he says.\u201d \u201cOkay,\u201d Glen said, turning to her. \u201cDoes Canada have a President, like we do?\u201d The woman smiled. \u201cWhat is this, twenty questions? We have a Prime Minister.\u201d \u201cAnd whose picture is on the Canadian one-dollar bill, madam?\u201d \u201cThe one-dollar bill? Why, um, that would be \u2026 the Queen!\u201d Glen unzipped his fanny pack and pulled out the plastic baggie full of Canadian currency. \u201cI can now return this to its rightful owner,\u201d he stated. Who does the money belong to?\nAnswer:","targets":["The tall bald man is the rightful Canadian owner of the Canadian money. He\u2019s the only one who didn\u2019t answer any of Glen\u2019s questions incorrectly; questions that most, if not all, Canadian citizens would know the answers to.\n\nOttawa is, in fact, the capital of Canada, not Toronto (Canada\u2019s largest city), as the little black-haired girl said. And John Cabot was actually the first European explorer to reach Canada, in 1497. Not Jacques Cartier, as the stocky blonde man stated (Cartier didn\u2019t reach the New World until 1534). And the Queen is indeed on the Canadian dollar, as the redheaded woman said, only Canada doesn\u2019t have one-dollar \u2018bills\u2019, they have one-dollar \u2018coins\u2019 \u2013 loonies, as Canadians call them, because of the loon depicted on the opposite side of the coin from the Queen.\n\nThe tall bald man was correct about there being a red Maple Leaf on his country\u2019s flag. And while he couldn\u2019t name the exact Canadian lake that is the largest \u2013 a tough question even for Canadians \u2013 he did mention it: Great Bear Lake."],"multiple_choice_targets":[],"multiple_choice_scores":[],"idx":161,"is_generated":false,"true_idx":161},{"inputs":"Story: \"It's impossible,\" shouted the emperor. \"No airplane could fly around the world. There's not enough fuel!\" \"That's 25,000 miles,\" argued Ren. \"But America's planes wouldn't have to fly all the way around the world. Hawaii is just 4,000 miles east of us!\" The emperor's forehead was creased with worry. A war raged between Japan and America. Five months ago, the Japanese flew their planes across the Pacific Ocean to attack American ships anchored in Hawaii. But despite their success, the Japanese emperor remained cautious. Could America's planes fly east across the Pacific and counter-attack Japan? Their safety depended on answering the question correctly. \"It's possible,\" argued Ren impulsively. Fifteen years ago, Charles Lindbergh surprised the world by flying from New York to France. It was apparent that Ren was anxious to impress the emperor. He was one of the emperor's youngest advisors \u2013 making him also the most nervous advisor. \"Charles Lindbergh only flew 3600 miles,\" interrupted Admiral Taro, whose military uniform intimidated Ren with its formal authority. \"And you're forgetting something else \u2026 an attacking plane has to carry heavy military supplies, so the planes can't fly as far. America's planes could only fly 2,400 miles, which wouldn't get them all the way to Japan!\" Ren felt his anger rising. Not wanting to give up on his idea, he pointed out that a ship could carry the plane's closer to Japan's coast. \"Preposterous,\" interrupted Admiral Taro. \"Your young imagination only wastes the emperor's time. How could these airplanes return to America? Fly by magic yet another 1,600 miles, to return to your imaginary ship?\" Ren's face burned with embarrassment, even though the emperor sternly ordered that sentinel ships begin monitoring the skies for signs of airplanes. The emperor had been facing a growing criticism that he wasn't doing enough to succeed. There were even reports that traitors were infiltrating government positions. \"These are unsettled times,\" the emperor said sadly. Suddenly Ren spotted Kira. He'd met her at school, but now she had the important duty of delivering messages to the emperor's admiral. He looked over at her shyly, but she didn't return his gaze. Ren felt self-conscious, knowing she'd seen his ideas rejected by the admiral. The next day, to their horror, they discovered that Ren was right, when 16 American B-25s bombed Tokyo. American newspapers cheered the surprise victory of \"Doolittle's Raiders\". It was April 18, 1942, and the famous American aviator had assembled 80 flying volunteers, who in teams of five had successfully piloted their mission. But how? Ren searched desperately for an answer in the newspaper reports. Even America's reporters wanted to know where the attacking airplanes had been hidden. America's President, Franklin Roosevelt, laughed and gave them the name of an imaginary island. \"They came from Shangri-La.\" Ren read the newspapers frantically, hoping no one spotted him in the library of the emperor's palace. Eight American pilots had been seen parachuting into the sea 1,000 miles west of Japan, near the coast of China. But Ren was genuinely frightened that the admiral would now assume that he'd been a spy helping them. Each echo seemed like it might be the steps of soldiers coming to arrest him. The admiral hated being wrong, and would assume that Ren knew about the attack in advance. And that would be treason. There'd be a trial, followed by a sad lifetime in prison. Suddenly, Ren felt a hand on his shoulder. It was Kira, looking strangely at her former schoolmate. \"You were right,\" she said, looking into his eyes sternly. \"And I'm in trouble,\" Ren sighed. \"We are all in trouble,\" Kira said, ignoring Ren's concern for himself. She took her duty to the emperor seriously, and had made a disturbing discovery. Kira unfolded a piece of paper marked \"urgent\" that was tucked in her pocket. \"Six hours before the attack, we received this transmission,\" Kira said quickly. The message warned that a sentinel ship in the ocean had spotted an American Navy carrier, just 650 miles away. \"But the admiral said the ship was mistaken, handed the message back to me, and said he'd wait for confirmation from a second vessel.\" Ren stared silently at the walls of the palace. So much had depended on whether that second message arrived. \"But it did arrive,\" Kira answered. \"I handed it to the evening messenger, Gina, telling her to rush it to the admiral! But the admiral said he never received it.\" Just then, the police arrived. The two officers grabbed Ren silently, while their commander said only that Ren was under arrest for treason. Kira held the transmission in her hands, and the suspicious commander said she'd be held for questioning too. \"Someone is sabotaging our military,\" he said fiercely. Locked in a jail cell, Ren pondered their predicament. He stared at the walls for hours, silent and lonely, realizing the surprise American attack was only the beginning of his problems. That night he had a visitor, Gina, the night messenger. \"I can only stay a minute,\" Gina whispered, \"but I'm in as much trouble as you.\" She explained desperately that the admiral believed the second warning was deliberately withheld. \"He's investigating all the messengers. Not only your schoolmate, Kira, but also me!\" \u201cDid you deliver the second warning?\u201d \"Yes!\" Gina insisted. \"It was during dinner, so I lifted his teapot to clear a place on the table. I was embarrassed because I'd burned my fingers, causing me to drop the pot and spilling tea on the message.\" \u201cDid you see him read the message?\u201d \"He dried it with a towel, and said it was still legible,\" Gina explained. \"But I was anxious to leave the room, and left before he'd read it.\" She heard voices approaching down the hallway, and whispered \"I must go!\" Then Ren was left to his lonely jail cell. The next day he was delivered in handcuffs to the military court. It was humiliating to be suspected as a criminal in front of people he admired. The courtroom was crowded with dignitaries like the emperor and Admiral Taro, as well as Ren's schoolmate, Kira, and her co-worker, Gina. Admiral Taro himself would conduct the cross examination, wearing his intimidating military uniform. Admiral Taro took important strides to where Ren sat nervously, then announced his first question to the courtroom. \"Isn't it true that you predicted, just one day before, that the American airplanes would attack Japan?\" \"And you were warned,\" Ren shouted defensively, \"not just once, but a second time by Gina the messenger!\" The crowd murmured as the admiral bellowed that the second message never arrived. \"We studied the first message diligently. We even tried following the American planes east to their ship in the Pacific. Perhaps it was the emperor himself who intercepted the message, determined to lose this war more quickly!\" The controversial message lay on the evidence table, still stained with tea. Suddenly, Ren put the clues together. \"I can prove I'm innocent,\" he told the courtroom. \"And I know who intercepted the message.\" Who intercepted the message?\n  choice: Gina\n  choice: The Emperor\n  choice: Admiral Taro\n  choice: Kira\nAnswer:","targets":["Admiral Taro"],"multiple_choice_targets":["Admiral Taro","Gina","Kira","The Emperor"],"multiple_choice_scores":[1,0,0,0],"idx":133,"is_generated":false,"true_idx":353},{"inputs":"Story: Thursday night, November 21, 1963. The weather was mild in Oklahoma City and the five friends gathered in the small apartment of Steve Collier to study for tomorrow\u2019s upcoming exams. They were all college students and not only were there tests to be taken tomorrow, the holiday season and final exams were creeping nearer and nearer. The evening was uneventful. All of them were seniors and had been friends for many years. Billy and Susan had dated for a while a couple of years ago but had broken up amicably and remained friends. Tonight was study night; tomorrow would be Friday night and time for weekend partying. Harrell left for home first, around 9:30. Harrell lived north of town and liked a good night\u2019s sleep before test taking. Since he lived with his parents, Harrell used Steve\u2019s telephone to call and tell his parents, he was on the way. It usually took about 20 minutes for him to drive from Steve\u2019s apartment in near north Oklahoma City to his home farther out north. Billy and Susan left next, at 9:50. The campus was a couple miles from Steve\u2019s apartment and occasionally Susan would walk back to her room when the weather was nice and if it was not too late, for curfew was at 11:00 and, after that, nobody could come in or out of the building until next morning. However, tonight she was tired and she gratefully accepted Billy\u2019s offer of a ride. When he drove her home, Billy would escort her into the building reception desk, and then drive to his home in south Oklahoma City. However, he was a little farther out and the roads were rougher and darker than those Harrell traveled when returning home from Steve\u2019s. In fact, several times Billy\u2019s father called Steve when Billy was late in getting home. Diana was the last to leave, but it was not until almost 11:00. Diana lived with her parents, closer to Steve\u2019s apartment than Billy or Harrell. Ever since she was a little girl, Diana loved to travel the dirt road around the east side of the lake when returning home. A very petite young woman, normally she very comfortably drove a Volkswagen but tonight she was in her father\u2019s Cadillac and felt older than her 22 years, for a Cadillac was an \u201cold people\u2019s car\u201d. Normally, Diana was not able to use her Dad\u2019s car, but since her parents were on vacation till Friday, she was able to upgrade to the much bigger Cadillac. After Diana departed, Steve did what little cleaning up was needed and went to bed. Little did he know then that tomorrow, one of his friends would be missing. In large part because of the tragic events in Dallas, which were now a little more than 12 hours away, nobody would be certain what happened until after President Kennedy\u2019s funeral. The next day, what would become known as the \u201cCrime of the Century\u201d happened at approximately 12:30 P.M. Oklahoma time, or CST, Central Standard Time, By 1:00 P.M. President Kennedy was pronounced dead and 75 million Americans would know of the shooting. That afternoon, overloaded telephone systems were breaking down all over the country and there were roadblocks as far north as Tulsa in Oklahoma, just in case Lee Harvey Oswald had not worked alone in murdering the president. The case of Steve Collier\u2019s missing friend simply slipped through the cracks, for nobody knew for certain there was a disappearance until after the shooting in Dallas\u2019 Dealey Plaza. The missing person\u2019s family did not decide to notify the authorities until around noon as the missing student was an adult who had spent the night out unannounced before. When they attempted to place the call at a little after one they could not get through. They were not able to get through to the police department switchboard until early Friday evening. By then, police forces all over the country were dealing with a possible national security issue \u2013 maybe even the cold war with the USSR was heating up to a live one. A harried and overworked local police force could only do so much. So, Steve would not learn of his missing friend until Tuesday the 26th. Normally, news of a missing person would be all over the news in Oklahoma City, still a small town at heart in 1963. But, the shock of Friday night and Saturday had not worn off when Oswald himself was murdered late Sunday morning by Jack Ruby on national television at 11:21 A.M. CST. President Kennedy\u2019s funeral was the next day, Monday, so there was no resemblance of anything normal until Tuesday morning. Steve, as did most Americans during that long nightmarish weekend, sat glued to his television set, scarcely aware of other events going on in the world, such as the tragic fire on Saturday at the Golden Age Nursing home in Fitchville, Ohio, which killed 63 of the 84 residents. Indeed, the streets of Oklahoma City were almost entirely devoid of traffic until after the president\u2019s funeral. For three days, Oklahoma City resembled a ghost town to those few who were out and about. But, finally, on Tuesday a sad and sorrowful nation went back to work. Steve\u2019s already overloaded senses were given another shock when Oklahoma City Police Lieutenant Rick Petit knocked on his apartment door early Tuesday afternoon. Steve had attended class that morning and had heard nothing concerning anyone being missing. After Lieutenant Petit explained his friend\u2019s disappearance after leaving the apartment Thursday evening and his knowledge of the Thursday evening study session, Steve fought through the emotional numbness he felt, thought for a few moments and said to the officer, \u201cI know who is missing without you having to tell me.\u201d Who is the missing person?\n  choice: Diana Scott\n  choice: Susan Allen\n  choice: Billy Friend\n  choice: Harrell Garner\nAnswer:","targets":["Diana Scott"],"multiple_choice_targets":["Billy Friend","Diana Scott","Harrell Garner","Susan Allen"],"multiple_choice_scores":[0,1,0,0],"idx":21,"is_generated":false,"true_idx":241},{"inputs":"Story: \"Abigail,\" he might say,\n\"It's America's first day.\" Before fireworks could burst, \none fourth of July came first.

Past the walls, the forest sounds,\nfell silent to bullet pounds. \"Still this fort's walls will protect us\nfrom the Tories who'd eject us.\" Nate knew everyone inside\nwould have no place else to hide. It was dusk now. Still alone,\nhearing Tory rifles moan, Nate's eyes scanned their wooden shell.\nAs outside the gunshots fell. To his horror, on one wall --\nsomething could destroy them all. Where the wooden walls were stocked,\none strong gate had been unlocked! His strong knot had been undone.\nWho has done this? Who's the one?

John came forward, thin but proud,\nspeaking in a voice quite loud, Answering, his voice excited, \n\"I know we will stand united.\" John said he'd seen knots that day,\nand they hadn't gone away. \"Though my wife -- as it grew late -- \nstood my last hour at the gate.\" John's wife nodded. \"This is true.\nI saw several knots there too.\" \"It was just an hour, though.\nAfter that, I'd had to go. I could see the new moon climb.\nIt was just past supper time.\" Nate confronted suspect three,\na young man from Tennessee. It's a teenager named Bo.\n\"That's untied? I didn't know. As I started, it grew late. \nSoon I couldn't see that gate! I'd assumed the gates were closed.\"\nNate searched in the eyes of Bo's. \"Was it always in your sight?\nDid you watch it through the night?\" \"No,\" said Bo. \"No, just, till two.\nThat was all that I could do.\" \"Please,\" said Bo, \"I'm just a peasant\nSleepiness was so unpleasant. Usually I work by daylight\non my farm, and sleep by midnight!

(\u201cHERO DETECTIVES LAUNCH INVESTIGATION OFFICE\u201d blared one headline in the local newspaper.) We\u2019d framed the article and hung it on our wall the day we opened. It was still hanging there\u2014over the phone that hadn\u2019t rung in two days. And then we heard footsteps coming down the hallway ... Larry looked at me, and the few hairs left on his head were sticking up with alarm. No one ever walked down our hallway\u2014and least of all, customers. Was it a criminal who we\u2019d locked away, finally coming back for revenge? Larry nodded towards the door, signaling that he wanted me to answer it. And then he tiptoed toward the corner and hid in the closet. I was worried, too. The glass on our door was frosted, but I could see the outline of an enormous body \u2014and then a giant fist pounded abruptly on the wood. I\u2019d had enough of this detective business, and flung open the door. The mysterious guest had a bucket and a mop. It was our janitor, Joe. I sighed with relief, and Joe smiled back. \u201cDid I scare you?\u201d he asked. \u201cI was trying to scare you.\u201d \u201cDetectives don\u2019t scare easily,\u201d I said. And then Larry opened the door of the closet and reentered the room. Joe stifled a smile, and Larry said defensively, \u201cI was looking for clues.\u201d Joe laughed, and said, \u201cAre you sure you weren't looking for coats?\u201d Larry grumbled that next he\u2019d try to locate his missing dignity. \u201cHow about finding this month\u2019s rent?\u201d Joe suggested. I started to explain we were working on a big case. \u201cYeah, the case of the missing rent,\u201d Joe persisted. I could see Larry getting annoyed. But then Joe said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m serious. I can\u2019t find this month\u2019s rent checks. Everybody stuffs them into that rent box on the wall by the manager\u2019s door. The box was fine when I left last night. But when I came in this morning\u2014the box was open, and empty. I think someone picked the lock and stole all the rent checks.\u201d \u201cOurs was in there already,\u201d Larry lied. \u201cIf it\u2019s missing, that\u2019s not our fault.\u201d \u201cWould you shut up and listen to me?\u201d Joe snapped. \u201cMr. Jorgensen always pays his rent in cash\u2014so there was one thousand dollars in that box! If I don\u2019t find it, he\u2019s going to think I stole it.\u201d \u201cWhy would he think you stole it?\u201d Joe reached into his gray overalls and pulled out an enormous set of jangling keys. \u201cJanitors have keys to the whole building,\u201d he said sadly, \u201cincluding the rent box. And now that it\u2019s missing\u2014I\u2019m the likeliest suspect.\u201d It was quiet for a second, until Larry finally blurted out, \u201cAre you hiring us?\u201d \u201cTell you what,\u201d Joe said wearily. \u201cFrom the way you\u2019re acting I\u2019m guessing you guys still haven\u2019t paid your rent yet. Am I right?\u201d Larry and I both nodded. \u201cFind that money before the manager gets here, and I won\u2019t tell him that you guys were late again this month.\u201d It was the best offer we\u2019d gotten all week. \u201cBut how do we know you didn\u2019t steal it?\u201d Larry teased. \u201cYou don\u2019t,\u201d Joe said. \u201cI\u2019d like a thousand bucks as much as anybody.\u201d He slid his bucket into the hallway, and headed for the elevator. *\t\t\t\t*\t\t\t\t* Larry and I ordered sandwiches\u2014we always thought better after a good meal. We were happy and cheerful when they finally arrived, and as we munched away, Larry tossed out some theories. \u201cMaybe Mr. Jorgensen is late on his rent too,\u201d he said, wiping some mustard off his lips. \u201cSo Jorgensen breaks into the box, and then claims he\u2019s paid his rent already.\" \u201cLike what you tried to do.\u201d \u201cExactly.\u201d \u201cMaybe you stole the money,\u201d I said. I took a bite of my roast beef sandwich, then offered yet another theory. \u201cOr maybe the building manager stole the money. He\u2019s going to keep the thousand dollars, and then blame the theft on Joe.\u201d \u201cOr maybe Joe stole the money,\u201d Larry said, \u201cand he\u2019s going to blame it on the building manager.\u201d My head was starting to hurt. Just then, there was another knock on our door. Larry grumbled about his lunch was being interrupted as he carried his sandwich with him to his closet hiding place. \u201cWho is it?\u201d I asked, swallowing the last of my roast beef. \u201cIt\u2019s Mr. Jorgensen,\u201d said an elderly voice. From the closet, Larry called in a high-pitched voice, \u201cMr. Jorgensen who?\u201d \u201cMr. Jorgensen-wants to-wring-your-neck. Now open the door, you jackass.\u201d I looked over at Larry, and asked, \u201cWhy are you giving him a hard time?\u201d Larry looked sheepish. \u201cI owe him money, too.\u201d Mr. Jorgensen looked very angry when we finally opened the door. \u201cHello, boys,\u201d he said. We weren\u2019t boys, but Mr. Jorgensen was nearly sixty years old\u2014so to him, everyone looked younger. His sweater was probably older than we were, and even it looked angry. It was red with a crooked, darker red stripe that made it look like the sweater was scowling at us. \u201cWould you like a sandwich?\u201d asked Larry. Mr. Jorgensen shook his head. \u201cMy stomach can\u2019t handle anything stronger than soup,\u201d he complained. \u201cYou know what it's like to eat nothing but soup?\u201d In response, Larry just took a big bite of his sandwich. This irritated Mr. Jorgensen, and he glared straight at Larry. \u201cSo, any chance you\u2019ll be paying me back that five hundred dollars you borrowed from me?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s funny that you mention that,\u201d Larry said, his mouth still full. \u201cJust yesterday I came by your office to pay you. But you were busy with a client, so I decided not to interrupt you.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re lying,\u201d said Mr. Jorgensen. \u201cSee this?\u201d He gestured towards his neck. Larry and I both stared at his ugly sweater. Poking over the neckline was about two inches of what was probably a red silk Hawaiian shirt. Mr. Jorgensen also had a dark suntan, a result of his recent trip to Hawaii, and he explained, \u201cI just got back from the airport\u2014and I\u2019m on my way up to the office now\u2014I definitely wasn\u2019t here yesterday.\u201d \u201cDid I say yesterday?\u201d Larry asked. \u201cOh, uh \u2026 I meant \u2026 last Christmas.\u201d Mr. Jorgensen mumbled something under his breath\u2014though I definitely heard the word \u201cstupid\u201d\u2014and shuffled out of our office. \u201cYou\u2019re making friends with everybody,\u201d I said. And once again, we heard footsteps coming down the hall. Returning to the closet, Larry shoved the last of his sandwich into his mouth. This time the closet was a good idea, because the man at our doorway was the building manager\u2014and he was so mad that his face was red. By the time our door swung open, he was already shouting. \u201cGive me one reason why I shouldn\u2019t throw you two out of here!\u201d Larry stayed in the closet. I sighed and said, \u201cBecause we\u2019re trying to help Joe find your missing rent money?\u201d That slowed him down. He was probably just as mad about the missing rent as he was at us for missing rent. He thought for a second. \u201cI think it was someone in the building who stole the rent,\u201d he said. \u201cSomeone busted open the back door and went straight to the rent box by my office. So it had to be someone who knew exactly where to look. Someone like you.\u201d \u201cBut it could\u2019ve been anyone,\u201d I said. \u201cWhy are you blaming us?\u201d \u201cBecause you\u2019re the only guys who haven\u2019t paid your rent this month,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd besides\u2014I don\u2019t like you. Your brother is a big wise guy. Where is he, anyways?\u201d \u201cOh, he\u2019s around here someplace,\u201d I said, trying not to stare at the closet. Our building manager stomped out of the office. It was quiet for nearly a minute, until I heard Larry\u2019s voice whispering, \u201cIs he gone?\u201d I turned to the closet, then said, \u201cLook at us. We\u2019ve got no money, and everybody hates us. Maybe we should quit the detective business altogether.\u201d Opening the door to the closet, Larry laughed. \u201cNot today. I had lots of time to think in there\u2014and I\u2019ve figured out who stole the rent money!\u201d Who stole the rent money?\n  choice: Larry\n  choice: the building manager\n  choice: Joe the janitor\n  choice: Mr. Jorgensen\nAnswer:","targets":["the building manager"],"multiple_choice_targets":["Joe the janitor","Larry","Mr. Jorgensen","the building manager"],"multiple_choice_scores":[0,0,0,1],"idx":15,"is_generated":false,"true_idx":235},{"inputs":"Story: Thursday night, November 21, 1963. The weather was mild in Oklahoma City and the five friends gathered in the small apartment of Steve Collier to study for tomorrow\u2019s upcoming exams. They were all college students and not only were there tests to be taken tomorrow, the holiday season and final exams were creeping nearer and nearer. The evening was uneventful. All of them were seniors and had been friends for many years. Billy and Susan had dated for a while a couple of years ago but had broken up amicably and remained friends. Tonight was study night; tomorrow would be Friday night and time for weekend partying. Harrell left for home first, around 9:30. Harrell lived north of town and liked a good night\u2019s sleep before test taking. Since he lived with his parents, Harrell used Steve\u2019s telephone to call and tell his parents, he was on the way. It usually took about 20 minutes for him to drive from Steve\u2019s apartment in near north Oklahoma City to his home farther out north. Billy and Susan left next, at 9:50. The campus was a couple miles from Steve\u2019s apartment and occasionally Susan would walk back to her room when the weather was nice and if it was not too late, for curfew was at 11:00 and, after that, nobody could come in or out of the building until next morning. However, tonight she was tired and she gratefully accepted Billy\u2019s offer of a ride. When he drove her home, Billy would escort her into the building reception desk, and then drive to his home in south Oklahoma City. However, he was a little farther out and the roads were rougher and darker than those Harrell traveled when returning home from Steve\u2019s. In fact, several times Billy\u2019s father called Steve when Billy was late in getting home. Diana was the last to leave, but it was not until almost 11:00. Diana lived with her parents, closer to Steve\u2019s apartment than Billy or Harrell. Ever since she was a little girl, Diana loved to travel the dirt road around the east side of the lake when returning home. A very petite young woman, normally she very comfortably drove a Volkswagen but tonight she was in her father\u2019s Cadillac and felt older than her 22 years, for a Cadillac was an \u201cold people\u2019s car\u201d. Normally, Diana was not able to use her Dad\u2019s car, but since her parents were on vacation till Friday, she was able to upgrade to the much bigger Cadillac. After Diana departed, Steve did what little cleaning up was needed and went to bed. Little did he know then that tomorrow, one of his friends would be missing. In large part because of the tragic events in Dallas, which were now a little more than 12 hours away, nobody would be certain what happened until after President Kennedy\u2019s funeral. The next day, what would become known as the \u201cCrime of the Century\u201d happened at approximately 12:30 P.M. Oklahoma time, or CST, Central Standard Time, By 1:00 P.M. President Kennedy was pronounced dead and 75 million Americans would know of the shooting. That afternoon, overloaded telephone systems were breaking down all over the country and there were roadblocks as far north as Tulsa in Oklahoma, just in case Lee Harvey Oswald had not worked alone in murdering the president. The case of Steve Collier\u2019s missing friend simply slipped through the cracks, for nobody knew for certain there was a disappearance until after the shooting in Dallas\u2019 Dealey Plaza. The missing person\u2019s family did not decide to notify the authorities until around noon as the missing student was an adult who had spent the night out unannounced before. When they attempted to place the call at a little after one they could not get through. They were not able to get through to the police department switchboard until early Friday evening. By then, police forces all over the country were dealing with a possible national security issue \u2013 maybe even the cold war with the USSR was heating up to a live one. A harried and overworked local police force could only do so much. So, Steve would not learn of his missing friend until Tuesday the 26th. Normally, news of a missing person would be all over the news in Oklahoma City, still a small town at heart in 1963. But, the shock of Friday night and Saturday had not worn off when Oswald himself was murdered late Sunday morning by Jack Ruby on national television at 11:21 A.M. CST. President Kennedy\u2019s funeral was the next day, Monday, so there was no resemblance of anything normal until Tuesday morning. Steve, as did most Americans during that long nightmarish weekend, sat glued to his television set, scarcely aware of other events going on in the world, such as the tragic fire on Saturday at the Golden Age Nursing home in Fitchville, Ohio, which killed 63 of the 84 residents. Indeed, the streets of Oklahoma City were almost entirely devoid of traffic until after the president\u2019s funeral. For three days, Oklahoma City resembled a ghost town to those few who were out and about. But, finally, on Tuesday a sad and sorrowful nation went back to work. Steve\u2019s already overloaded senses were given another shock when Oklahoma City Police Lieutenant Rick Petit knocked on his apartment door early Tuesday afternoon. Steve had attended class that morning and had heard nothing concerning anyone being missing. After Lieutenant Petit explained his friend\u2019s disappearance after leaving the apartment Thursday evening and his knowledge of the Thursday evening study session, Steve fought through the emotional numbness he felt, thought for a few moments and said to the officer, \u201cI know who is missing without you having to tell me.\u201d Who is the missing person?\nAnswer:","targets":["Lieutenant Petit, who had slept little since Thursday evening, numbly replied, \u201cExcuse me?\u201d\n\nSteve looked at the lieutenant and said, gently, \u201cWell, excuse me, Lieutenant. I know you probably don\u2019t know as much about this as you would if the president had not been shot.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s safe to say,\u201d Petit replied, dryly.\n\n\u201cThen let me explain. It\u2019s easier to tell you who is not missing. I know that it cannot be Susan, even though I did not see her since Thursday night. Not only did Billy take her back to her dorm, but word of her not returning would have been all over campus this morning, which it wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nPetit nodded his head, not mentioning that Susan Allen was properly logged back in Thursday evening at the dormitory reception desk and that she stayed in her room all weekend, still in grief and shock over the slain president.\n\nSteve continued, \u201cIt couldn\u2019t have been Billy either. If Billy had not returned home, his worry-wart dad would have called me. He\u2019s done it before.\u201d\n\nAgain, Petit nodded, but he was nodding in such a way as not to confirm or deny what Steve was saying. Petit knew that Billy Friend was another of the group who stayed away from class since Friday.\n\n\u201cHarrell had to have made it home. I know that is where he was heading because he called his parents before leaving. Since his parents were home, they would have reported him missing.\n\nPetit said, evenly, \u201cSo, you know it was Diana Scott who is missing.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s got to be her. I suppose you know that she was in her dad\u2019s car Thursday night.\u201d Steve shuddered, \u201cShe always drives home around Lake Hefner. She is a short girl and Mr. Scott\u2019s Caddy is huge. I bet she lost control on that dark and bumpy lake road.\u201d More importantly, her parents were on vacation, so they would not have been there to report her missing.\n\nAFTERWARD\n\nWednesday morning, November 27. Mr. Scott\u2019s Cadillac was hoisted out of a shallow inlet by the lake road running alongside. Diana\u2019s dead body was slumped against the steering wheel. Apparently, she had been knocked unconscious when hitting the water. Lieutenant Petit was both saddened and relieved to find the body; relieved because this completed the search for Diana Scott before the Thanksgiving weekend began, saddened because he would have to inform her parents of the bad news and ruin their holiday.\n\nPetit noticed that the Cadillac\u2019s dashboard clock was stopped at 11:10, fitting perfectly with what Steve Collier had told him. He would think often in the years to come that young Miss Petit died less than an hour before that fateful day of November 22, 1963, commenced at midnight.\n\n\nNOTE: While this story is a work of fiction, much of it is taken from a little known occurrence in Oklahoma City. On the evening of Thursday, November 21, 1963, a woman and her daughter left the home of friends to return to their home approximately five miles away. They were never seen or heard of again, until in the spring of 1990, when a small inlet off of Lake Hefner was drained and filled for an interstate highway project. The car and remains of the missing women were found in the lakebed, the dashboard clock indicating they had driven into the lake in late evening. The local police departments admitted that, had they not been so preoccupied with the Kennedy murder the next day, 200 miles south in Dallas, they would probably have been discovered the missing women much earlier. Known as the Elston case, this was, at the time of discovery, the oldest open case in the Oklahoma Bureau of Investigation."],"multiple_choice_targets":[],"multiple_choice_scores":[],"idx":46,"is_generated":false,"true_idx":46},{"inputs":"Story: It was a quiet morning in Indianapolis. But as I was enjoying coffee and listening to my wife's desperate attempts at piano, my phone rang and I was speaking to Kevin King. Kevin King was the son of a long-time friend. He was a tall but rather thin fellow and worked as Room service in the Augustus Hotel in Miami. His father had helped me through my years through very specific methods. That guy also insisted him on police work, even teaching him martial arts and all about guns. But Kevin was undisciplined. Let me summarize our conversation on the phone since his uneasiness made him talk real slow. One Banker, Roger Shelby was murdered in Augustus Hotel room 22B. His wife was shot in the back. Kevin was one of the suspects since he was in the couple's room at the time of the crime, delivering meals. \"You gotta help, Uncle Nate!\" he sounded sorry. \"I can't go to jail or in court. Dad's coming home tomorrow from his medical operation. I can't miss him in the airport.\" That didn't sound like something of dire importance, but since I don't like people wrongly accused and I don't want Old Jeff to be upset, I agreed. \"Alright, alright. Get an investigator on the line. Tell him it's me.\" \"You're not coming here?\" \"Unnecessary. Now get someone on the line and tell him it's Nathan Grant.\" He hung up and the telephone rang 20 minutes later. \"Am I speaking to Detective Grant?\" a raspy voice spoke. Yes but no. I'm retired so it's just Mr. Grant now. And don't worry you can take all the credit for this case, Mister?\" \"Bachmann. Detective. Bachmann. I can't believe its you!!! I'm a big fan of your work.\" \" Thank you then, Detective Bachmann. Please give me all details on the case.\" I sat down by our old swing in the yard and prepared my mind. \" Okay. So um... about 11:19 p.m last night, Mr. King called 911 saying Mr. Shelby shot himself and shot her wife. She is safe in the hospital now, however. The gun used was 9mm pistol with a silencer and was unlicensed. The main suspects are Dianne Shelby, Kevin King, James Castro and Mr. Shelby himself. We all suspect it suicide, sir. But Mrs. Shelby didn't believ-\" \"Hold on, detective. Let's do it from the start. Who is Mr. Shelby?\" \"He's a banker, 44 years old, muscularly built, 5 foot 5 inches, blonde, tanned, blue eyes, married to Dianne Shelby for 13 years, and they have a 12-year old son. The family came here on the 3rd of October. Mr and Mrs. Shelby stayed on 22b while their son, who insisted on having his own room, took 21c. As I said, he was shot by a 9mm silenced pistol--which had his fresh fingerprints and saliva of another man-- twice in about 11:15 pm as everyone heard it. The wounds are located just beside his right ear and he fell on his left side as if from he came from a kneeling position. His wife and the room service, Mr. King was in the room when this happened.\" \"Describe the rooms to me.\" I might have sounded cold but... \"Augustus hotel is cheap. Both rooms are exactly alike --they both have green carpet flooring, a window looking over the far beach, a few lamps, white wallpaper, a random painting above bed-- except that the couple's room have one king-size bed.\" \" Describe Mrs. Shelby, Detective Bachmann.\" \" A 5\"2 woman, 43-years old, brown hair, brown eyes, tanned skin. She admitted that she was in bad terms with her husband due to her frequent infidelity. She told us that last night, she saw him with some woman. He was apologizing, kneeling to her, when room service came. She left him kneeling and Mr. King was welcomed. A few seconds later, silenced though very audible gunshots were heard. Mrs. Shelby was shot in her back and his husband was lying dead with the pistol a few feet away from his head.\" \"You did more than describe Mrs. Shelby. But it's alright. So Mr. King saw it and called 911? And this happened in about 11:19 pm.?\" \"Yes and yes. Mr. King was in the bathroom and after peeking in the beds and seeing what happened. He silently called 911, afraid that the killer will see and hear him. \" Bachmann replied. \"Where were the Shelbys earlier that night?\" \"They were on the beach from 10 a.m. Mrs. Shelby and her son came home at 10:10 p.m as the kid was already tired. Mr. Shelby insisted for just a few more minutes, he came home at 11 p.m.\" \"And where does the Castro you spoke of fit in here? Why is he a suspect?\" \"Mr. Castro was also taking a vacation. He's 55 years in age, a retired swimming instructor and a widower. It's his first time here in Miami and he came alone. His room was 21b. He was nowhere to be found yesterday and just came to the scene at midnight last night. He looked weary and very suspicious. His saliva also happened to match the one we found on the gun.\" \"What was his alibi? What does he look like?\" \"Mr. Castro said he was just seeing the beach and he said he doesn't know how his saliva got there. Could've just been an error in the forensics' side, you know. \"He was a 6'2 man. He had frizzled hair and brown eyes. He walked in poor posture. He said he had back problems. He was wearing some generic hawaiian shirt and shorts. They looked unused, I might add. He might've bought them in some shops here,\" \"The couple's room was 22b. Which floor was that on?\" \"The third floor, sir.\" \"Were there signs that Mr. Shelby was shot at point-blank range?\" \"No, sir.\" He really should stop calling me sir. \"And both Mr. King and Mrs. Shelby didn't saw him do it even though they're so near from him?\" \"They didn't. They just heard it. Oh and in her testimony, Mr. King went to the bathroom because he can't hold his leak.\" This detective is not amazing in stating facts in an organized manner. \"But the weapon had a silencer but was still very loud, yes? And why did Mrs. Shelby believe his husband didn't do that himself?\" \" She just said she feels that something's wrong.\" \"Do the hallways cameras agree with the alibi of all suspects?\" \"Yes, sir. But we haven't checked the street cameras yet.\" \"I see. And Mrs. Shelby was right-handed?\" \"No, sir.\" \"Where was Mr. Shelby lying?\" \"Near the window.\" \"His left side was facing the bathroom door?\" \"Yes.\" After a few seconds of thought, I rose to a solution. \" I got it, Detective Bachmann. And tell the hotel to improve their security.\" Who is the murderer?\nAnswer:","targets":["\"It was Mr. Castro.\"\n\n\"Really? I swore it could've been suicide.\" Bachmann replied.\n\n\"Mr. Shelby used a gun with a silencer. No one knows how it got there. And in my experience spontaneous self-murderers don't use silenced guns when they are near the same room with their spouse. Remember that we must twist theories to facts. Not vice versa.\n\n\" And Mr. King was educated in guns, He couldn't have made the mistake of thinking that a silenced 9mm pistol is as silent as a a hum. Mr. Shelby's left side was to the bathroom meaning he couldn't have shot him from there.\n\n\" It also makes no sense for this to be a murder-and-suicide case. Suppose Mrs. Shelby did it. Why then would she shoot herself from her back? How would, in a few seconds, this woman put on gloves come near to her husband's right side and shoot him? It seems unlikely, detective.\n\n\" We cannot ignore the forensic evidence of Castro's saliva on the gun. Tell me some situations where you accidentally put your saliva on objects.\"\n\n\"Sleeping, drinking--\"\n\n\"Right, sleeping. You also say that Mr. Castro was a tall man and had back problems. What if he entered the room, snuck under the bed and bent her tall body to fit(causing back problems afterwards), waited patiently, falling into sleep every now and then? So now we have a planned murder. Is it not more logical for planned murders to contain silenced weapons than spontaneous ones?\n\n\"He said he went out having fun but why buy a hawaiian shirt in your first time in Miami. His skin was also still untanned. These facts may not point him to the murder but it does point out he had not spent time outside. I'm sure if you check where he bought that shirt and shorts, you'll find him lying. Already enough evidence without the street cameras which would show he was not outside.\"\n\n\" But how did he get in the room?\" Detective Bachmann exclaimed.\n\n\"There are very simple ways, detective. First he could've went into the room way before 8 a.m which you somehow didn't care to look away from. Or he could've done the old under-the-room-service-table trick which could've even contributed to his back problem.\"\n\nI saw Castro on the newspaper a day after that. Who knew that he was a neighbor from the Mr and Mrs. Shelby's home in New York. He said he was tired of how these guy kept cheating and he was even more angry because of the way his wife is used to it. I don't know if that's a valid reason enough to stalk and kill. But at least justice was served."],"multiple_choice_targets":[],"multiple_choice_scores":[],"idx":127,"is_generated":false,"true_idx":127},{"inputs":"Story: Andersonville Military Prison, deep in the heart of Dixieland Georgia, was the most dreaded of Confederate prisoner-of-war camps. It was such a grim place that the rebel soldiers guarding it were fed and clothed little better than their 33,000 Yankee prisoners. From its inception in February 1864, until the Civil War\u2019s end 14 months later, 13,000 prisoners would die; an astonishing 29% mortality rate. Many of the Union soldiers succumbed to starvation and exposure to the elements, but some were also murdered, as was the case with Private Glendenning Bryan. Sgt. Crosby, Sgt. Thornton, Pvt. Whisenant and Cpl. Horner shared a tent with Pvt. Bryan \u2013 if you could call a few small tree limbs that served as poles, plus a few tattered blankets and threadbare shirts, shelter at all. Because the tent was so small, privacy was virtually non-existent, and this only added to the shock and dismay when the friendly Bryan, a young 19-year-old from Boston, was found dead with a knife wound in his stomach when the sun came up early one steamy Monday morning in August 1864. Crosby, the 38-year-old no-nonsense senior non-commissioned officer and Chicago, Illinois, policeman, took charge. Speaking within the confines of the small tent, he said, \u201cHe\u2019s murdered, murdered right here. I don\u2019t know why, he would\u2019ve been dead in a few days anyway.\u201d Bryan had been in Andersonville the longest and was the most malnourished and sickest of the five. However, they soon discovered why Bryan had been killed. He had been hoarding food in his clothing, planning to eat it when he felt better. Inside his trousers they found a crudely sewn, hidden pocket that contained breadcrumbs and a few tiny pieces of salt pork. The likable Bryan had been killed for food. \u201cWell, it wasn\u2019t me that did it,\u201d said the short-tempered Horner, another native of Massachusetts, as he viewed his friend who lay dead just inches from his bare feet. \u201cMy hands are useless with arthritis and I can\u2019t hardly hold a knife.\u201d Horner was 40-years-old and had spent too many years shoeing horses in the cold weather of his home in Worcester. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t have been me,\u2019 chimed in Thornton. \u201cI was outside walking most of the night.\u201d \u201cMost of the night is not all of the night,\u201d Crosby pointedly replied. Thornton, a 26-year-old librarian from Philadelphia and quietest of the residents of the tent, winced at this suggestion. \u201cDid anyone see you?\u201d asked Crosby. Thornton looked at each man in turn before answering, \u201cNobody saw me, but I was out walking last night. I was.\u201d \u201cI was sick, couldn\u2019t eat, couldn\u2019t sleep, so I was down by the sinks all night,\u201d offered Whisenant, the normally amiable 30-year-old New York school teacher. \u201cI got back here just a few minutes ago.\u201d Crosby hadn\u2019t slept in the tent the previous night, either, and told them so. \u201cI was at the other end of the camp, trying to get what fresh night air was available.\u201d That was an ironic statement, as it was known that the stench from Andersonville was so severe it was noticed in the city of Americus, several miles away. \u201cI didn\u2019t notice any of you fellers last night. Just me and Bryan,\u201d said Horner, thinking out loud. Slowly, he asked, \u201cWho owns the knife?\u201d \u201cAnswer that and we have our killer,\u201d Thornton added, dryly. For a few minutes they all sat in silence. Finally, Crosby said, \u201cI got back here first. I found Horner asleep and Bryan dead.\u201d Horner shot Crosby a mean look, pointed a gnarled finger at him and said, \u201cI told you I didn\u2019t kill him!\u201d He winced in pain as he did so. \u201cEasy, corporal, easy, I\u2019m just thinking.\u201d \u201cWell, for whatever it\u2019s worth to you, I didn\u2019t sleep well,\u201d Horner said. \u201cWho does in this place? I was asleep for only an hour or two and did not see or hear anything, except the usual camp noises.\u201d \u201cOK, let\u2019s continue,\u201d said Crosby. \u201cI was on the other side of the camp with various friends; not with any one person the entire night, but I was never alone.\u201d Turning to Thornton, he asked, \u201cWhat about you? Horner didn\u2019t sleep well, says he didn\u2019t see you.\u201d \u201cHe probably didn\u2019t. I only came back to the tent a couple of times. When I heard him snoring, I did not go in. I didn\u2019t want to bother him. The last time was about an hour ago. It was too dark to notice anything unusual about Bryan.\u201d Crosby digested this for a moment and then asked Whisenant, \u201cYou were sick last night?\u201d \u201cRight,\u201d he replied. The sight and shock of the dead Bryan did nothing to quiet his queasiness, although he was a butcher by trade in his hometown of Zeeland, Michigan. With great effort, he managed to control a wave of nausea. He needed to go outside and Crosby excused him. Whisenant returned a few minutes later, weak but feeling better. He dreaded resuming the conversation, but he re-seated himself in the cramped tent and looked at Crosby. Finally, Crosby stated bluntly, \u201cI know who killed Bryan.\u201d Who is the killer?\n  choice: Private Jamie Whisenant\n  choice: Sergeant Josiah Thornton\n  choice: Corporal Wardlow Horner\n  choice: Sergeant Coleman Crosby\nAnswer:","targets":["Sergeant Josiah Thornton"],"multiple_choice_targets":["Corporal Wardlow Horner","Private Jamie Whisenant","Sergeant Coleman Crosby","Sergeant Josiah Thornton"],"multiple_choice_scores":[0,0,0,1],"idx":117,"is_generated":false,"true_idx":337},{"inputs":"Story: Ed Pederson owned and operated the Village Clock Shop for over 40 years. And when his wife passed away, Ed spent even more time in his shop. \u2026 Too much time, some might say. It was an unpleasant surprise when Ed found his store in disarray after 7:00 a.m. one bitterly cold morning in January. Upon inspection, Ed learned that a thief had broken in the back door. The burglar\u2019s plan would have been to steal money from the brass plated, old-fashioned cash register in the middle of the shop. However, the intruder did not realize that Ed emptied the contents of the cash drawer every night. Ed took extra precaution to protect his business, and hid the money for bank deposit in a floor safe underneath the antique roll top desk in his small office. The thief had done a fair amount of damage. Besides the damaged rear door, there were table and mantle clocks strewn about on the shop floor. There was also a broken display case. To make matters worse, a mouse had bitten into a lamp cord in the front shop area and Ed had to reset the circuit breaker to get the electricity back on. Ed noticed that three of his clocks and two watches were no longer running. It was a source of pride for Ed that the greatest majority of the clocks and watches in his shop worked properly at all times. Of course, he would often find one or two in need of winding or battery replacement, but this was a tiny percentage of the more than 200 clocks and watches in the store. He was careful to sell only the pieces that kept accurate time, regardless of the age and skill level needed to maintain them. Before calling the police, Ed noted the times on the clocks and watches that had stopped working. One watch and one of the clocks not working were on the floor, knocked over by the intruder in his nervous and angry haste. The other two clocks and watch remained in their normal places, apparently undamaged. However, Ed knew from previous experience that something as mild as a door slamming in the small shop would often cause one of his old clocks or watches to stop running. Ed discovered that a grandfather clock manufactured in 1929 had stopped running at 10:10 p.m., a little over an hour after he went home the previous evening. An early 20th century mantle clock which he found on the floor was stopped at 10:59 p.m., and an office clock mounted on the wall with a 1955 manufacturing stamp on the back of it was frozen at 2:01 a.m. A 1970s era battery-operated wristwatch, which was on the floor, had quit running at 3:18 a.m., and a beautiful old silver pocket watch from the 1880s was stuck at 5:22 a.m. Ed surveyed the damage. Numbly, by habit, he placed a new battery in the wristwatch and it began ticking. He set it to the current time: 7:29 a.m. Ed knew the intruder was in the shop between the hours of 10:10 p.m. and 5:22 a.m. Cursing silently, (as he chastised himself for not having a burglar alarm installed) he called the police department. It was a few minutes after 8 o\u2019clock when his old friend, Detective Wesley Bingham, arrived at the shop. Ed poured hot coffee for both of them. Detective Bingham knew his friend well and realized that Ed would have a detailed assessment of what happened. Wisely, he allowed the older man to speak without interfering with questions. Ed began, \u201cSome time between 10:10 last night and 5:22 this morning, somebody broke into the shop. Whoever it was broke down the back door and entered the front area. Perhaps because he needed to leave the lights off, he knocked several objects over and broke a display case. He must have been nervous, in a hurry and very angry after he saw the cash register drawer open and empty.\u201d Bingham sipped on his coffee and replied, \u201cPlease continue.\u201d \u201cNothing is missing,\u201d Ed told him, \u201cbut three clocks and two watches were not running this morning. They were all stopped at different times. I suspect one of them quit running when the thief broke down the door or broke the display case.\u201d Ed relayed to the detective the timepieces and respective times they had quit working. Bingham thought for a moment, and then asked, \u201cTell me what you observed about each timepiece.\u201d Ed warmed to his topic. He was coming down from the initial shock of finding his beloved clock store vandalized. The hot coffee and comforting presence of old friend helped him organize his thoughts. He began to think out loud. \u201cThe grandfather clock sits in the corner, over there.\u201d Ed pointed to the corner farthest from the cash register and broken display case. \u201cThere are no signs of visible damage, the clock appears normal. Obviously, it was not in thief\u2019s path of destruction. The burglar would have to really shake the place for the grandfather clock to stop. Normally, the only time such a clock stops is if the weights and chains are tangled.\u201d Bingham asked, \u201cWhat about the mantle clock?\u201d Ed replied, \u201cThe mantle clock was on the floor. It took a pretty good lick. There\u2019s a dent in the wooden floor, but it\u2019s made of heavy brass and only has a slight scratch. I have to accept a little bit of blame for that one being on the floor. I was looking at it last night just before going home and left it sitting too close to the edge of the counter. I found that it needs a cleaning. I guess I will do that today and look for damage.\u201d Ed poured a second cup of coffee for both of them before continuing, \u201cThe pocket watch is in a display case by the front window. Nothing in that case was affected by my visitor \u2026 it\u2019s too far from the center of the room.\u201d He smiled and continued, \u201cPocket watches from the late 1800s are tough and were built to withstand horse and wagon rides.\u201d Pulling it from the case, he showed it to the detective. \u201cIt\u2019s made of silver, one of my favorites. I just rebuilt it last week.\u201d Bingham smiled at his friend. It always pleased him that Ed had been blessed with a passion that allowed him to earn a living. He knew that Ed\u2019s love of timepieces had sustained him since the death of his wife. Finally, he asked, \u201cWhat about the other watch?\u201d Ed said, \u201cIt does not appear to be damaged, even though it was on the floor. A new battery has it running just fine now.\u201d Bingham asked, \u201cHow about the wall clock?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s one of those commercial electric wall clocks from the 1950s,\u201d Ed said. \u201cThe kind you used to see in offices everywhere. It still has its original cord and plug. However, it didn\u2019t appear that the thief was anywhere near it.\u201d Wesley Bingham answered, \u201cWell, Ed, I have some news for you. A young man named Aubrey Behrens was arrested early this morning. One of your neighbors on the block saw him loitering on the sidewalk. He was arrested and brought to the station before you called. He has cuts and bruises on his hands and arms. His girlfriend was with him, and she swears they were together at her place just before their arrest. I need to know when Behrens was in the shop. I can tear their story apart and rattle him if I have a timeline on this breaking and entering.\u201d Ed smiled and said, \u201cWesley, now that I have had time to think this through, I can give you the exact time that he was here.\u201d When was Behrens in the shop?\nAnswer:","targets":["Wesley smiled back, \u201cI\u2019m not surprised. I\u2019ve always known you would have made a great detective.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know it has to do with the times on the clocks and watches when they stopped running. Often old clocks and watches just quit running. But, I knew right away it wasn\u2019t the battery-operated watch. A new battery got it running again immediately. The old battery simply died. The grandfather clock had not been disturbed. It was too far away from the action to be shaken and the weight and chain mechanism was normal. Again, sometimes an old clock or watch just stops and that is what happened with the grandfather. The same is true with the pocket watch. It was undisturbed in the front case, far from the burglar\u2019s sphere of influence. That type of watch was built to withstand shock. I probably goofed when rebuilding it last week.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cThe electric wall clock stopped when the mouse bit into the lamp cord, tripping the shop area circuit breaker.\u201d Pausing, he looked Bingham in the eye and said, \u201cThat leaves the mantle clock. A heavy clock like that would normally withstand a fall to a soft wood floor, but it needs a cleaning and it did not take much to make it quit running.\u201d\n\nWith disgust and anger evident in his voice, he said to Wesley, \u201cYou may ask your suspect why he felt it necessary to illegally enter my shop around 10:59 p.m. last night.\u201d"],"multiple_choice_targets":[],"multiple_choice_scores":[],"idx":157,"is_generated":false,"true_idx":157},{"inputs":"Story: There was finally a smooth west wind that plumped the sails of our vessel and carried us beyond what the rowers could have done on their own. When the order came to stack oars, relief was felt beyond the galley itself. Regardless of what people say, it is a difficult thing to hear those cries and moans. And, I think, it rather takes away from our civilizing mission on these Crusades. Or, maybe I worry too much. Anyway, this journal will be safe from prying eyes. Except for Captain Fosters \u2013 he\u2019s the only one on the crew who can read. I would doubt that many of the passengers had either the capacity or the interest to read -- certainly not Sir Francis Walters, the leader of this expedition! He prides himself on leaving that sort of thing to Morgan Grant, his clerk. I don\u2019t like him much, I must confess. Imagine taking a first name! His clerk surely puts on airs. Only the quality needs that distinction, in this year of Our Lord 1204. After so many adventures, it was good to finally board a solid English ship once again, thanks to our expedition leader, Sir Francis Walters. He had sent mounted messengers, and arranged for us to be met at Zara along the coast, not far from our victory a year or two ago. Now at least it was safe for an English ship to sail in these waters. I wonder how long that will last. Some may say that our quest was a failure in any event, since we never got to Jerusalem, or anywhere near it. Others say we accomplished our purpose, which was the settling of accounts in Constantinople. Still, it is bothersome that we sacked the greatest city in Christendom, and left the heirs of Saladin alone! That Italian Doge, Enrico Dandolo, was responsible. He had enemies, and we needed his shipping. But I am getting ahead of myself. From Zara we had sailed due west, then taken in fresh supplies at Sicily, paid for with good English gold (taken from the treasury at Constantinople, I must admit). We rounded the sea-lanes past Gibraltar, and were now headed due north, towards England and home. It is odd to think that all of this happened just yesterday. We were taking back to England, for installation at Canterbury Cathedral, a precious and ancient robe, said by some to have been worn by saints of the early church, and called for that reason the Robe of the Saints. It was plain, without fancy embroidery of any sort. It was believed that this precious robe, wound around the body, could cure any wound. That was what made it different from the other robes, both plain and festooned with precious gems. These ornate robes had been taken as well, so that they could be better safeguarded in England, of course. When the chest was first placed on board, it was opened by Godefroi, a villein used for heavy work (requiring muscles and no brain). We all got a glimpse of the treasures contained therein. Each robe had a paper that gave its history and dignity. Those Byzantines were certainly scholarly, I\u2019ll give them that. All of the robes were then replaced by Godefroi in their proper order, and stored in the one massive chest that was stowed in the ship\u2019s hold, and watched over by Godefroi. In this case, he was supposed to frighten away any intruders who might be curious about the chest. He clearly failed in his task, and under the lash, gave the following information. His supper had been placed on the floor of the hold as usual, but his candle had guttered out, and he didn\u2019t see who had served it. He smelled the food, relit his candle, and ate and drank. Shortly afterwards, he had fallen fast asleep. When he woke, some hours later, he felt drugged. He saw that the chains on the chest were unfastened, and fearing theft, he had summoned the guard. In the presence of Sir Francis Walters, Morgan Grant and myself, the chest was opened. Morgan Grant looked at each cloth robe that was in the chest, one by one. One robe was missing: the Robe of the Saints. We knew one thing, of course, that the Robe of the Saints was still on board ship. We had not docked since the theft. That information, however, did us precious little good, since the plain robe looked like any other ordinary robe, of which there were dozens on board. But the real one, of course, was of great value. Sir Francis asked me to look into the matter -- discreetly, of course. Smelling the mug, I could detect a peculiar odor, bitter and unpleasant. It smelled like that overpowering herb that the enemy uses to induce dreams and reduce pain when surgery is needed. I\u2019ll say this for the enemy in the privacy of this journal - I\u2019d rather be treated by one of their surgeons than by one of our own! Then all through today I discreetly, as requested, traced the movements of everyone on board, both the crew of 12 and the 41 passengers. The galley rowers I excluded, as they were locked into their galley room, even when not rowing. It would have taken a revolt for them to roam around the ship, and that had not happened. In the end, nearly everyone, including myself, had kept company at the time that Godefroi was given his supper. So everyone could prove, by someone else, his innocence. That included myself, I am relieved to note. Everyone except three people, that is: Captain Fosters, Sir Francis Walters and Morgan Grant. Captain Fosters told me that since it was a rocky sail in the early evening that he had stayed in his own cabin. \u201cYou have no idea how inconvenient it is to use a peg leg in a storm, m\u2019boy, and I hope for your sake you never find out!\u201d he said. Morgan Grant spent most of the evening in private prayer. A devout man, he confessed to me that he was terrified of stormy weather at sea, and he prayed that the ship would ride out the storm. Sir Francis looked at me with scorn, and with rum on his breath, said: \u201cI got drunk, that\u2019s what I did - that\u2019s what anyone with a grain of sense would do in a storm at sea, you blockhead!\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s all right, Sir Francis,\u201d I said. \u201cI know who stole the Robe of the Saints. And I am sure that with persuasive methods, you will soon have it back where it belongs, with the other robes in the chest.\u201d Who stole the Robe of the Saints?\nAnswer:","targets":["Sir Francis Walters had spent the evening drinking, and was too drunk to steal the robe.\n\nMorgan Grant\u2019s religious fervor makes him an unlikely thief of a holy object, and he would have been spotted getting Godefroi\u2019s meal. Also, it would not have been possible for Captain Fosters, with his peg leg, to maneuver down to the hold in a storm with Godefroi\u2019s supper.\n\nGodefroi staged the theft. Although illiterate, he had taken each robe from the chest in the first place and replaced them in the same order. He thus had memorized which robe was the actual Robe of the Saints. He had expected that it would fetch a high price, given the relics market in England at the time.

He\u2019s a\u201d \u201cSheepsman, of course,\u201d Sir Loch interjected, examining the stout, ruddy-complexioned fellow. \u201cHe operates a hundred-acre gorse farm this side of Glasgow, on which he tends to two-hundred head of sheep and lambs. Married, with four young children, proud owner of a late-model lorry. You\u2019ve been shearing early this year, sir, due to your heavy debt load. But your dog has gone missing, and you\u2019d like me to find him.\u201d \u201cAstounding!\u201d Kinnair exulted. \u201cHow did you know all that?\u201d \u201cElementary. Right, my dear Watt-Sun? You see, I\u2019m one of the silent partners who hold the note on your ancestral McMurray farm, and, as such, am privy to all of your assets and liabilities and family history. As for the rest,\u201d Sir Loch waved his hand, \u201cwell, the excess wool on your coat attests to your recent shearing activities, and the presence of Scotland-renowned canine expert Dr. Watt-Sun attests to your mission.\u201d \u201cAmazing!\u201d the man marveled. \u201cBut enough chit-chat,\u201d Sir Loch said. \u201cHow and when did your dog happen to go missing, sir?\u201d Kinnair explained to the amateur sleuth how just three days earlier he had allowed a traveling troupe of four buskers to camp in a corner of his field for the night \u2013 a mime, a stilt-walker, a living statue and a balloon twister. The following morning, the troupe had vanished, along with Rover. \u201cHe\u2019s me best sheep-herding dog, is Rover,\u201d Kinnair lamented. \u201cNo other dog reacts to my oral commands better or quicker.\u201d \u201cTo Edinburgh!\u201d Hoames suddenly exclaimed, donning his deerstalker. Before Dr. Watt-Sun could question or protest, he added, \u201cThe Edinburgh Festival Fringe has just commenced, and it is most certainly to that three-week carnival of plays, performances and antics that our troupe has trekked.\u201d Within the hour, Dr. Watt-Sun and Sir Loch were disembarking from the express train to the Scottish capital. They made haste for the large encampment of entertainers known annually as Buskerville; a vast tent city to rival any Depression-era Hooverville. It was where the more cash-strapped fringe performers lived during the length of the festival. Sir Loch had disguised himself whilst on the train. He was decked out now in a green leotard, multi-pronged red-and-white belled headgear and Aladdin-like slippers. So attired as a frolicsome court jester and armed with a musical recorder and the detailed physical descriptions Kinnair had supplied of the suspect performers, he sought to infiltrate the camp. \u201cWho might you be?\u201d a burly juggler demanded to know, blocking his way. The man was juggling several large clubs, and it was obvious he knew how to use them for more than just show. Other camp denizens quickly surrounded the interloper, as well. Sir Loch immediately began cavorting about, gesticulating wildly, pratfalling constantly, raising a smile even on the scowled lips of the juggler. Then he wetted his own lips, affixed them to the recorder. A most heartrending version of Greensleeves piped out of the shrill instrument, tearing the eyes of his audience and convincing them of his authenticity. He was welcomed into the camp, along with his companion, Nurse Mirth (a\/k\/a Dr. Watt-Sun). Once within the enclave, Sir Loch flipped a switch on the underside of his pearl-white recorder and piped a note only a canine audience could appreciate. The dog whistle did the trick as hounds of all shapes and sizes came bounding down the rows of tents almost barreling the detective and doctor over. Watt-Sun quickly identified Rover from her veterinarian dealings with the pooch and collared and leashed the animal. \u201cAnd now to apprehend the dognapper,\u201d Sir Loch remarked. They located the mime first, attempting to escape from an invisible box. He was speechless in the face of Sir Loch\u2019s pointed questions, his lily-white face the picture of innocence. Rover licked one of the man\u2019s feet, and the mime yelled at the dog, but since there were no actual words, Rover paid no attention.\nSir Loch suddenly spun around, his bells jangling and stared upwards at the stilt-walker looking down upon the proceedings. \u201cYou there with your head in the clouds,\u201d he questioned, \u201cyou didn\u2019t steal this dog from the McMurray farm, did you?\u201d \u201cThat dog? No,\u201d the giant replied from twenty feet up. \u201cWhat use would I have for such a small dog?\u201d Sir Loch gestured at the duct tape wrapped tightly around the left wooden leg of the towering man. \u201cBroke your leg recently, I see.\u201d \u201cYeah, some little kid got tangled up in my feet a couple of weeks ago, made me stumble and snap a leg.\u201d \u201cIndeed. It must be difficult to keep track of youngsters from such a height.\u201d The man started striding away, and Rover barked wildly at a Chihuahua that was directly in the path of the lumbering giant, scaring the miniature dog away just before it was trampled. Dr. Watt-Sun screamed. Sir Loch whirled about. He observed that the vet had bumped into what looked amazingly like a Greek statue. Until the statue had moved, catching the good doctor in his muscled arms. \u201cThe living statue, I presume?\u201d Sir Loch commented, scrutinizing the half-naked, grey-painted man. \u201cAnd what do you know of the theft of Kinnair McMurray\u2019s dog?\u201d But the man had turned to stone again, striking an Apollo-like pose. Rover sniffed at the \u2018statue\u2019s\u2019 leg, then lifted one of his own. \u201cHey!\u201d the stony-faced performer yelled, jumping backwards before the dog could do any business. Both Rover\u2019s and Sir Loch\u2019s ears suddenly cocked, as they heard the unmistakable huffing and puffing of someone blowing up a balloon. Sure enough, three tent rows over, they came upon the balloon twister, the fourth member of the troupe who\u2019d once occupied a small corner of Kinnair McMurray\u2019s land. She stilled her lungs when Hoames, Watt-Sun and Rover approached, her balloon half-filled. There were other performers standing about watching the woman, and Rover began barking at them, his herding instincts getting the better of him. He nipped at their heels, forming the throng up into an orderly crowd in front of the balloon artist. \u201cHmmm,\u201d Sir Loch mused aloud, \u201cthat kind of canine talent would come in handy for gathering a crowd together \u2013 a paying crowd. Wouldn\u2019t it, twister?\u201d She shrugged, pursing her lips and puffing again. Rover watched, wide-eyed, as the rubber inflated. But when the balloon sculptor started making with the squeaky manipulations that rapidly twisted the white and black balloon into a spotted Dalmatian, Rover yelped and tried to run off in the opposite direction. Holding tight to the dog\u2019s leash, Dr. Watt-Sun said, \u201cI don\u2019t see how we\u2019re ever going to figure out who took Rover, Hoames.\u201d \u201cHa!\u201d Sir Loch exclaimed. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019re barking up the wrong tree there, my dear Watt-Sun.

A great deal of gossip was available at the Martin Tea Shop, and much of it was of good value, setting the stage for Miss Marple\u2019s later, amazing deductions. That is why a fortnight away from home required her to catch up on what had happened during her absence. She could never tell when some tiny detail might later provide the evidence to solve a local mystery. Her visit in Shropshire had been interesting, and it was fun to see old friends, but now she was home again. Surprisingly, the local news was so exciting that she didn\u2019t even have to ask. Friends and neighbors sort of blurted out their versions of what had happened during her absence. She had no sooner settled in at her usual table at Martin\u2019s Tea Shop and ordered some tasty buttered scones with jam and a pot of tea, when she first heard the news. \u201cYou haven\u2019t heard? It just surprised all of us so,\u201d said Alice Wiggins, her longtime friend and bridge partner, pausing to sit down at Miss Marple\u2019s table and a bit short of breath. \u201cAnd I always thought that Elmer Tydings was honest as the day is long!\u201d Alice was louder than usual, and soon everyone in the tea shop wanted to share what they knew with Miss Marple, their local sleuth celebrity. \u201cOf course you must have heard, Jane dear, about the robbery at the church,\u201d said Tom the Postman, who was stopping by the Martin Tea Shop to deliver their mail. \u201cNobody talked about anything else for days. It must have happened, let me think, just a few days after you left for your holiday. Of course, everyone knows that Elmer didn\u2019t do it!\u201d He glared at Alice. \u201cYes indeed, Jane,\u201d added Martha Jenning, another friend, who drew up a chair to share the sense of excitement, \u201cwe have had quite a time here in St. Mary Mead.\u201d \u201cTell me all about it, Tom\u201d Miss Marple said, smiling at Alice and Martha, while leaning forward at her tea table. She knew from experience that Tom the Postman was a close observer who did not let his imagination run wild. His version would be a good place to start on this mystery, whatever it was! \n\u201cAll right, they won\u2019t mind if I just take a minute and rest my feet. Besides,\u201d he confided, \u201cthe Postmaster is gone to Salisbury for the day, so I\u2019m my own boss.\u201d He knitted his brow for a moment, wanting to make sure that he got the details right and in the correct order. He had Miss Marple\u2019s close attention and valued her good opinion. \u201cIt was the Sunday after you left, Jane. We were all at church, of course, and the Vicar had given a good sermon, not too long this time. It was most interesting. I wish I could remember what it was about.\u201d \u201cSin, most likely,\u201d Alice added helpfully. \u201cHe\u2019s always against it.\u201d Tom glowered at her for a moment, then resumed his story. \u201cIt was about the value of old traditions,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Vicar was telling us to value what we have, and he was going to use for an example the old bible that is usually kept under lock and key at the vicarage.\u201d \u201cYes, Jane,\u201d Martha added impatiently, aware that Tom always took forever to tell his stories, \u201cbut he couldn\u2019t. The bible had been stolen!\u201d \u201cNot the King James Version!\u201d Jane was really shocked. Their village copy consisted of fifteen separately bound pages of the original 1611 first edition. These were the fifth, sixth and seventh chapters of the Gospel according to St. Matthew, which told the story of the Sermon On The Mount. How did these pages become separated from the original bible? The legend was that a knight from the region wanted these pages always with him when he went to battle. And so this precious excerpt was separately bound as a small volume. Over the years, his family had died out, and the small volume had been left to the village church. Its value was considerable. It was the most valuable possession of the local church. For that matter, it was probably the most valuable single object in the entire village. Tom the Postman plodded on. \u201cThe Vicar announced that the bible was gone, and he added that it was such a shame. He had been going to bring it to our attention, but the fact is that it is such a valuable property, that the money it would have brought at auction would have more than paid for repairs to the church roof. For, like Shakespeare\u2019s church and last resting place at Stratford, many repairs were needed quickly, and there was just not enough money to pay for them.\u201d He shook his head firmly, showing agreement with himself. \u201cThat, of course, was the bombshell, if you see what I mean,\u201d Alice added. \u201cThe Vicar said that he had been going to consult with the entire village on the matter before the bible was put up for auction, but now, the bible and the chance to raise the necessary money, were both lost.\u201d Miss Marple\u2019s eyes narrowed, as though she was seeing something far away. \u201cDid anyone know about the Vicar\u2019s plans to sell the bible? Has an arrest been made?\u201d Tom glowered at Martha and went on. \u201cOnly four people knew about it, John and Louise Stubbs, and Elmer and Katherine Tydings,\u201d he said. Miss Marple shook her head knowingly. It was a mystery why two couples that disliked each other so much were always on committees together. Tom went on. \u201cWe found out that they disagreed about selling the bible. John and Louise Stubbs, however reluctantly, favored selling the bible. Louise Stubbs knew its value from her library work. Her husband John, who has that farm a few miles outside the village, has fingernails so dirty that he doesn\u2019t have any interest in books. Even his wife won\u2019t lend him books from the St. Mary Mead library! \u201cNow, Katherine Tydings, on the other hand, was very much opposed to selling the bible: she just wouldn\u2019t hear of it - the book must stay here. You know how strong willed she is, Jane! Of course, her husband Elmer went along with her. He always does.\u201d \u201cWhen was the bible last seen?\u201d Jane Marple wanted to know. \u201cIt was the night before the service,\u201d Tom replied. The five of them were meeting about selling the bible. The way the Vicar told it to the police, there was quite an argument.\u201d (Jane remembered that Tom\u2019s brother Frank was a patrolman on the St. Mary Mead Constabulary.) \u201cElmer Tydings was so upset, that he actually grabbed the bible and left the church. That was the last time that anyone saw the bible.\u201d \u201cIt all sounds straightforward enough,\u201d Miss Marple said. \u201cElmer is now in custody, I presume.\u201d \u201cYes indeed, on the Vicar\u2019s statement,\u201d Tom replied. \u201cBut he absolutely denies having stolen the bible. In fact, he claims that he soon thought better of things, and that it was returned later that night to the church. He and Katherine had talked it all over. He says he wrapped it carefully, and Katherine drove into town and put the book through the door slot on the side door of the church, which is used for donations of books throughout the week. He wanted to see a show on television, so Katherine drove their car into town and returned the book. \u201cKatherine corroborates his story. And there is a witness who saw her walking from her car to the church.\u201d \u201cDid Elmer know what was on television?\u201d Tom answered. \u201cYes, my brother saw the same show, and they talked about it.\u201d Was the door locked?\u201d \u201cYes, Jane. But nobody looked at the donations for hours. Nobody does until the volunteer librarian shows up. That\u2019s her job. It\u2019s Louise Stubbs, of course, and she usually spends an hour or so there in the late afternoon after she finishes cataloging the books at our local library. She doesn\u2019t recall seeing the book. As a matter of fact, Louise says she had nearly a sleepless night after that scene at the church meeting, falling asleep so late that she didn\u2019t even go to the church after she finished work at the town library.\u201d \u201cWho knew,\u201d Miss Marple wanted to know, \u201caside from Elmer and Katherine Tydings, that the book had been returned?\u201d \u201cJust the Vicar himself, it seems. He was telephoned by Katherine the night the bible was taken. He promised that if the book was returned, he would not press charges against Elmer. But he had an emergency to attend to and didn\u2019t make it into church until late the following afternoon. With no bible, he called the police and gave them a statement. They have detained Elmer.\u201d \u201cWhat an interesting thing to happen in our little town,\u201d Miss Marple observed. \u201cI\u2019ll have a little chat with the Vicar. He clearly thought he was doing the right thing. I hope he won\u2019t be too embarrassed if I have to tell him the wrong person has been arrested!\u201d Who stole the bible?\n  choice: John Stubbs\n  choice: Louise Stubbs\n  choice: Elmer Tydings\n  choice: Katherine Tydings\nAnswer:","targets":["Katherine Tydings"],"multiple_choice_targets":["Elmer Tydings","John Stubbs","Katherine Tydings","Louise Stubbs"],"multiple_choice_scores":[0,0,1,0],"idx":154,"is_generated":false,"true_idx":374},{"inputs":"Story: \"Eddie's missing.\" \"How is that even possible? He weighs 240 pounds!\" The classroom laughed at Reggie's joke, but I was worried. Eddie Cavanaugh was the high school's star quarterback. Each week his expert passing led the football team to victory, and no other school in the state had ever won this many games in a row. \"People say jocks are stupid, but Eddie isn't,\" sighed our history teacher. \"He was making our little town famous, and now he's gone.\" Eddie's mother had called the principal's office about one o\u2019clock when she noticed Eddie was missing, and soon everyone in the school was talking about the news. He'd come to school that morning, but then somehow, he'd vanished! As the last school bell rang, I asked Reggie if he wanted to search for Eddie. \"Sure, why not?\" Reggie laughed. \"If we find our missing quarterback, then WE can be the school's heroes.\" But where could we find some clues? The locker room was a good place to start. As we approached, we heard the team shouting enthusiastically \"One! Two! Three! Go!\" as they shuffled out onto the field. Tomorrow they would play an away game in Capitol City - a two-hour drive - so they were getting some extra practice today. We smelled grass and sweaty uniforms, but then we spotted Mr. Roster, the assistant coach, talking on his cellphone. \"Eddie's mother just called me,\" he was saying with exasperation. \"Look, we're doing everything we can.\" His brow furrowed in anger. \"No, we're not canceling the game...\" We waited until the call was done, then asked about Eddie's disappearance. \"You don't realize how important someone is, until they're not around!\" Mr. Roster sighed. \"The team knows it, too. Eddie always led an inspiring cheer after school before each practice. We miss him already.\" Can we search his locker? Reggie asked. The coach looked at us suspiciously, but realized we were trying to help. He led us into his office, where he retrieved a clipboard with all the lockers' combinations. Inside Eddie's we saw his jersey - number 17 - dangling from a hanger. There was nothing unusual in the locker. There were his cleats, his helmet, shoulder pads, kneepads and a sack lunch. But on the door of the locker, we found Eddie's secret motivational tool. He'd drawn a graph for himself, showing various records for high school football. First it showed the school's record for consecutive wins and then the state's and then the record for the entire country. As Coach Roster ran after two players who were arguing, I motioned to Reggie. Coach Roster's office door was open, and we snuck in to search for clues. Reggie opened a filing cabinet and saw manila folders in alphabetical order. He quickly looked for the C's, while I started searching Coach Roster's desk. Its top was filled by a giant desk calendar. I checked yesterday's date, which just said \"Practice,\" like every other day this week. But today's date had an unusual entry, \"Visit Dr. Lazlow, 9 to 11a.m. Capitol City.\" Reggie retrieved a file labeled \"Cavanaugh, Eddie.\" There was a handwritten note. \"Eddie, stop playing, or you'll get hurt, Mae\" it warned. \"What are you doing!\" shouted a voice behind us. Coach Roster had returned and caught Reggie and me by surprise. \"We were looking for clues about Eddie,\" I answered nervously. \"Well, you might as well know,\" sighed Coach Roster wearily. \"That note turned up on the locker room door yesterday. I should've taken it more seriously - but who the heck is 'Mae'?\" Reggie had an idea. \"Eddie's girlfriend is named Marissa! I bet Mae is her nickname.\" Now we had a trail to follow - but where was Marissa? If she was missing too, it might explain Eddie's disappearance. Marissa wasn't a cheerleader, just a hard-working student from a very poor family. Reggie found her family's listing in the phone book, and soon we were traveling to her address. It was a small apartment in a large complex. Marissa's father answered the door, then called out \"Marissa, are you here?\" \"Go away!\" shouted a voice inside. \"Marissa, get out here!\" her father yelled. We waited anxiously, until a bedroom door opened, and we saw our unhappy classmate. Her hair was messy, and her make-up was smeared. It was obvious that she'd been crying. \"What do you want?\" she asked us. We're looking for Eddie, I told her. \"So's half the town,\" she said bitterly. \"Everyone loved Eddie.\" We agreed and couldn't help talking about his popularity. \"It's so unfair,\" Marissa complained. \"Eddie was always so alone. He didn't have a father or even a brother or sister. There is just his mother. And yet this town became his family. He'd made everyone so proud.\" Reggie and I nodded, but Marissa continued, her thoughts far away. \"Eddie said that more than anything he just wanted to get engaged to me some day and settle down as a hero in this very same town. But now he's gone.\" \"Maybe he'll send a message to you, Mae,\" Reggie said, nonchalantly. \"Who's Mae?\" she asked, with irritation. We were running out of clues, but decided to visit Eddie's mother. Her house was a few blocks from Marissa's, and we hoped she wasn't upset when we rang her doorbell. Mrs. Cavanaugh was glad to see friends of Eddie's and quickly invited us in. \"I always worried Eddie would hurt himself,\" Mrs. Cavanaugh said. \"All the phone calls I've gotten show what Eddie meant to this town. But I just want my darling boy back.\" Her wall was filled with pictures of Eddie, some in his football uniform, others showing him as a young boy. I asked her when she'd first noticed Eddie was missing. \"I always make him a healthy lunch,\" Mrs. Cavanaugh sighed. \"I leave it on the kitchen counter, since I have to leave for work ten minutes before Eddie leaves for school.\" \"But this afternoon when I came home from work - his sack lunch was still there!\" Mrs. Cavanaugh said with exasperation. \"That's when I realized that Eddie was missing.\" \"We're looking for him,\" Reggie assured her. \"I'm glad to know his friends care about him,\" she smiled. She talked about Marissa and her hopes for her son. \"Come back and visit any time.\" On the sidewalk, Reggie was upset. \"I don't know who could've done this,\" he complained. \"Everyone loved Eddie. In fact, maybe Eddie faked the whole thing himself,\" Reggie said, more serious than I'd ever seen him. \"Being the star quarterback wasn't enough for him. He wanted everyone to worry about him too.\" \"I'm not worried,\" I said, \"because I know where Eddie is. And if you study the clues, you'll know too.

She did not shudder any more: these noises had become a way of life around the little town. Her father and two older brothers had joined the Continental Army as soon as the British had fired on Lexington. Many of the farmers and their sons from the small town had joined the ranks and left the women, children and elderly men to fend for themselves. But they had to fight for their freedom. Abigail's father had been a minister, in charge of a secret which he told Abigail one night before he left. Up the long flight of stairs he had taken her to the bell tower atop the assembly hall. Behind the locked door he told her were barrels of gunpowder and boxes of ammunition. Taking her gently in his arms, he told her to keep the secret. \u201cI'm counting on you to watch it for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI know you are young, but we all must do our part in the war. I and General George Washington are counting on you.\u201d \u201cI will keep it safe for both of you,\u201d she responded. But that had been weeks ago, and still the army had not come for their ammunition. Abigail alone had the key that would open the great lock on the door. She could not tell anyone. The rest of town was comprised of Tories that would try to take the supply away if they knew, so she did not tell anyone, not even her mother, lest someone overhear them. Only she would ring the bell to call the congregation to assemble. Alone, Abigail worried every time a thunderstorm rolled into the area. Would lightning strike the steeple? Shuddering, Abigail would try to push the thought away. She must not think like that. The day progressed slowly, the same as every Friday before had. They scrubbed the floors in the house and assembly hall, while Henry, a local drunk, kept himself busy fixing things around the house and hall. A Tory, Henry had worked for Mr. Smith in his locksmith shop before he had been fired for missing several workdays. His wife and young daughter had fallen ill and Henry had been unable to pay for a doctor \u2013 on the low pay he received \u2013 to travel to see them. Since there was no doctor nearby, his family died. He then turned to the bottle to forget, also upset at himself for not having asked for help. He let pride get in the way of his loved ones\u2019 lives, but he really blamed Mr. Smith. Abigail's thoughts turned to Mr. Smith. Besides also being a Tory, Mr. Smith was a locksmith. This had always puzzled Abigail, since there was no high demand for a locksmith in the small town. Mr. Smith was the wealthiest man in town. However, because of Abigail's father's stand on the war, he refused to set foot in the assembly hall, never having been in there, to Abigail's knowledge. Later that Friday afternoon, Mr. Samuel paid a visit to Abigail and her mother. Mr. Samuel was the only other man besides Abigail's father who knew about the location of the ammunition. He had bought the supply and instructed her father to hide it for him. He looked knowingly at her, and she curtly nodded her head in acknowledgment. All was in order; she had checked the supply earlier that morning and would do so again before bed. He acknowledged her reply. \u201cGood day Miss Abigail,\u201d he stiffly bowed, his old body riddled with arthritis. Although dusty and tired from all the cleaning, Abigail's mother invited him in for tea. However, Abigail asked her leave to finish beating the rugs free of dust. As Mr. Samuel and her mother entered the house, Abigail began to whack the rugs. A moan interrupted Abigail. She paused, trying to spot its location. Again she heard it, coming from the bottom of the hill her house sat on. Running down the hill, Abigail was concerned about the person who had made that noise. As she made it to the bottom, she saw the figure of a soldier. A Continental Army soldier was lying face down in the tall grass. \u201cOh, Dear!\u201d she cried as she knelt next to him. She turned him over, and was surprised to find the soldier was barely older than a boy. Blood oozed from a wound on his head. He was feverish and his eyes fluttered open when she supported him. \u201cDo you know a Miss Abigail?\u201d he asked, struggling to stay awake. \u201cI am she.\u201d \u201cI had a message from your father, but ... it was stolen.\u201d He raised his hand and touched his head. \u201cSomeone hit me and stole the message.\u201d \u201cOh, dear!\u201d Abigail said again, unsure of what to do next. \u201cYou need help, but we have to be careful,\u201d she warned him, \u201cThe town is full of Tories. Can you stand and walk if I help support you?\u201d The boy nodded, still winching from the pain. Abigail helped him to his feet and pulled his arm over her shoulder. Slowly they walked up the hill. Abigail kept a close watch on both the house and the town beyond them. They must not be seen! Once inside the assembly hall, she lowered the boy down on a pew. \u201cI'll be back with some food,\u201d she promised, hurrying from the room. Running to the kitchen, she grabbed some bread and milk as well as bandages and water for the boy's wound. He ate ravenously while she bandaged his wound. Afterward, she retired to bed. She slept fitfully, feeling she had forgotten something. A sound awoke her and she remembered. The ammunition in the tower had been forgotten. Silently she slipped out of her bed and grabbed the key that lay on the table near her bed. Not willing to light a candle, she felt her way to the tower in total darkness. Up the long stairwell, and into the lock she fitted the key. As she turned the knob, a hand reached out of the darkness and grabbed her. She tried to scream and struggle, but the voice reassured her it was all right. It was the solder, so she relaxed. \u201cWhat are you doing up here?\u201d he inquired, releasing her from his grasp. Shuffling her feet, Abigail wondered what to answer. He must not know about the ammunition, or he would have told her, but she must not tell a lie. Quickly the boy acted, he pushed open the door, and walked in. Abigail was worried and followed, but to her surprise all the ammunition was gone! The barrels and boxes she had worried and kept watch over were gone! \u201cIs something missing,\u201d the soldier asked of her. \"Yes...but I know who took it.\" Who stole the ammunition?\n  choice: Mr. Samuel\n  choice: Young Soldier\n  choice: Henry\n  choice: Mr. Smith\nAnswer:","targets":["Henry"],"multiple_choice_targets":["Henry","Mr. Samuel","Mr. Smith","Young Soldier"],"multiple_choice_scores":[1,0,0,0],"idx":70,"is_generated":false,"true_idx":290},{"inputs":"Story: Ed and Ellen McAnn lived in a semi-rural area. There were rows of houses on both sides of the street but, once you left the small neighborhood they had lived in for almost ten years, you had to travel over a mile to get to the next populated suburb. Ed and Ellen liked the semi\u2013privacy of being out, but not too far out, from the edge of the town. They never knew what to expect on Halloween. Some years, they had numerous costumed children come to their door, happily shouting to them, \u201cTrick or Treat! In other years there was only a handful. Ed, a detective with the City Police Department, never could figure out why this was the way it was. But, on this night, he didn\u2019t care. Ellen had agreed to answer the door and pass out treats to the many or few who would visit their home. He had a favorite movie to watch on television. The evening was crystal clear and beautiful. The moon was shining bright above their home, which sat on the north side of a street which ran east and west. In their neighborhood where there were few trees, there was more than ample lighting for children walking over lawns and across public streets. Ed and Ellen\u2019s daughter Crystal brought their grandsons over just after dark. She didn\u2019t see Crystal pull her car into the driveway, as it sat to the extreme west of the property and out of view of the front door. They were the first trick or treat customers and Ellen was not only surprised but delighted. This year, she was handing out starlight mints. She knew this wasn\u2019t much but there had been the death of her aged uncle last week and there had been little time to shop and prepare for Halloween. She felt badly but there was nothing she could do about it. Ellen soon realized this would probably be a year of few children coming to the door. It was almost an hour later before the first one arrived at the front door and, over the course of the next couple of hours, there would be only four more. She turned off the porch light and closed the door just after 9:00 p.m. She and Ed thought no more about Trick or Treat night until the next morning. As Ed opened the garage door to leave for work, he noticed something propped up on the driveway, close to the door and blocking his exit. It was a small model tombstone, which bore the inscription: Few treats in this house, I fear; Tricks to all who live here! Beside the tombstone, there were a couple of broken eggs that created a small but inconvenient mess to clean up. The garage doors sat several feet back from the front of the house and anyone wishing to pull a prank by the door would do so unnoticed. Ed remembered his wife\u2019s concern over the lack of goodies to pass out. It seems one child resented the modest starlight mint treat and wished for more. After assisting Ellen with the cleanup, he told her they would discuss it after he returned from work. That night, Ed and Ellen relaxed after dinner. He said, \u201cTell me about last night.\u201d Ellen answered, \u201cWe only had five kids come to the door. I\u2019d like to know which one pulled the \u201ctrick\u201d on us. I recognized all of them and would like to call the parents.\u201d Ed said, \u201cKeep talking.\u201d \u201cWell, the first child, dressed as a witch, hurriedly appeared from the direction of the Smiths, our neighbors to the east and left going towards our neighbors to the west. After listening for the traditional \u201cTrick or Treat,\u201d I dropped a mint into the witch\u2019s brew pot and the child skipped away. I was a little concerned for the witch because her costume was so baggy and loose fitting that I feared she would trip and hurt herself.\u201d \u201cNext came the lion. He was very small and with his father. After thanking me I saw them head toward the Smith home. They didn\u2019t seem unhappy with the small treat.\u201d \u201cA little while later the ghost appeared. The ghost was very real looking in the moonlight as the slight breeze kept blowing the sheet, which served as the costume. The ghost came from the direction of the driveway and headed east after thanking me for the starlight mint.\u201d Ellen continued as Ed intently listened. \u201cNext came Superman. This boy was a little older and the tight fitting costume showed off a developing, muscular physique. He didn\u2019t seem unhappy with his treat, either.\u201d \u201cLast was Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz. Before leaving our door, her little dog, dressed as Toto, ran into the street to chase a rabbit in the moonlight. I went outside to make certain everything was OK. \u2018Dorothy\u2019 didn\u2019t retrieve her dog until they were several houses up the street.\u201d Which direction did they go? \u201d \u201cWest.\u201d Ed thought a minute and smiled. He said to his wife, \u201cYou think you know who all of the five children were? \u201cYes, I\u2019m certain of it. I know them all from volunteering at the school.\u201d \u201cGood. I know whose parents you need to call.\u201d Who created the mess?\nAnswer:","targets":["Ellen brought both of them a cup of coffee as he prepared to explain himself. Thanking his wife for the welcome refreshment, he began, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the lion.

But, what counts him out is that you saw them head towards the Smith\u2019s and away from the garage.\n\nI also rule out the ghost for the same reason.\n\nNow, Superman is a different story. You didn\u2019t say which direction he came from or departed to, but his costume rules him out.

Having completed his arrangements late the day before with the bank\u2019s executives, he was the first patron of the morning. Standing alone in the bank\u2019s commodious quarters, he regretted he had no one with whom to share his happiness. Suddenly, as he was making out his deposit slip, he decided to use his own name, Everett Mead, instead of his stepfather\u2019s name, by which he had been known most of his life. It would be a simple matter to arrange this with the officials later. As he blotted the deposit slip, Everett Mead felt a new sense of poise and self-assurance take possession of him. He gazed fondly at the name which proclaimed him a wealthy man. By changing it he could completely sever former associations and start life anew. What a wonderful day it was! The cashier, impressed with the amount of the deposit, was very obliging and wondered, as he thought of his own meager salary, how it would feel to have so much money. \u2018I see you are left-handed, Mr. Mead,\u2019 he said, in an effort to appear interested in such an important personage. \u2018Yes,\u2019 smilingly. He left the bank without further conversation. Less than an hour later his name had been forged to a check for five thousand dollars, despite the fact that no one knew he had changed his name and no one had seen him make out his deposit slip.

Grandpa hated the sunshine, and waited eagerly for dusk. \u201cIt's too hot,\u201d he complained bitterly. And then he told them about the treasure. \u201cWhen I was 5 years old, my grandfather told me a secret,\u201d he said, \u201cand then insisted I make him a promise. \u2018If you live past 80 years old, you can tell it to your grandchildren,\u2019 he'd said.\u201d Grandpa fanned himself with a magazine. \u201cThis secret has traveled 150 years. It's the story of Dead Man's Island.\u201d Poison was rumored, or perhaps natural causes. No one knew exactly how that famous dead man came to be dead, or even who he the dead man was exactly. \u201cIt was a tiny, 120-foot island,\u201d Grandpa said, \u201cand with everyone knowing he'd been buried there, it was the only name they could think of!\u201d Grandpa studied everyone carefully, like he was hoping they could unravel the mystery. \u201cWhat became California belonged to Spain then,\u201d he told his two grandchildren, \u201cand later to Mexico, though not until 1821.\u201d Grandpa glared at the sun. \u201cLonely souls came here on ships and traded barrels of food for cowhides from the local Mexican ranchers, which they sold for huge profits when they returned to the East Coast. Enormous herds of cattle roamed the flat lands. It wasn't until later that the city became Los Angeles.\u201d But 150 years ago, a trading ship's sailor shared a secret with Grandpa's grandfather. The captain of the S.S. Charleston had buried a valuable treasure exactly 17 miles due north from the center of Dead Man's Island \u2015 and then 17 paces east. \u201cThat night they had to set sail around South America and back to Boston; but it was a stormy night, and their ship was lost at sea. When my grandfather heard the news, he realized he was the only person alive who knew where their treasure was buried.\u201d \u201cAre you making this up?\u201d Bobby challenged. \u201cWhy didn't you look for the treasure yourself?\u201d \u201cBecause the island disappeared. I though my grandfather might've made it up, and he never gave me a good explanation. But he did tell me the island had disappeared in 1928. And he swore the treasure was nearby, less than 300 miles.\u201d \u201cMaybe it's in Los Angeles,\u201d volunteered Ann, Bobby's sister. \u201cCould be,\u201d Grandpa replied confidently. \u201cUp until about 80 years ago, there were maybe 900,000 people here. Nowhere near the 12 million people that are here today. Then irrigation came, and highways, and big airplane manufacturers. It'd be funny if underneath it all was a forgotten sea captain's buried treasure.\u201d Ann wanted to find the treasure, but only to please Grandpa. Bobby was thinking of everything he could buy with a stake in a 150-year-old treasure. Soon they were asking the local librarian for her newest atlas of maps, and then studying California's coast. There were several islands near San Francisco's coast, and even one that they called Treasure Island. But San Francisco was 400 miles north, and Grandpa's grandfather had insisted that Dead Man's Island was within 300 miles. 25 miles south of San Pedro, California, they found Santa Catalina Island \u2015 but it was over 20 miles long (and 22 miles from the coast)! They wondered if Lisa, the librarian, had given them a defective atlas. Lisa was a young college student, and she seemed eager to help them find any island within 300 miles; especially since Ann told her that if they could find Dead Man's Island, there was treasure just 17 miles north of it \u2015 and then 17 paces east! \u201cI've spent five years at college studying the history of California,\u201d Lisa announced, seeming anxious to prove how knowledgeable and helpful she could be. She pulled down several books about Sacramento. But, still, they never found Dead Man's Island. When they returned to Grandpa's house, a mysterious stranger was talking to him. Grandpa did most of the talking, and the stranger looked like he'd rather keep quiet. \u201cThis is my friend Mike, and he gives boat tours to tourists,\u201d Grandpa explained. \u201cHe's been sailing our coast for the last 15 years. So I asked him if he'd ever heard of Dead Man's Island.\u201d Mike stared back, silently. \u201cAnd he said yes!\u201d Grandpa said. \u201cHe has a newspaper article that proves it.\u201d They looked hopefully at Mike, who stood still and unsmiling, before walking toward his jeep. Mike returned silently with a book about the history of Los Angeles. He opened the book in front of everyone, turning to a page about the community of San Pedro. Silently, he pointed to a picture on page 128, which displayed a lonely fence traveling down a steep hill; and in the background was the ocean. No more than 120 feet long, close to the shore, was a rocky island. \u201cDead Man's Island, 1873,\u201d read the picture's caption. Even though it was an hour's away, Ann insisted they go there right away. \u201cIt's gone,\u201d Mike muttered. They dredged the harbor in 1928. They wanted to make it easier for ships to enter the port, and they dug away the entire island!\u201d They consulted a map and identified the right location, which was just 17 miles north. \u201cNow let's get going,\u201d shouted Grandpa, \u201cbefore this afternoon gets any hotter!\u201d They bought four shovels, and Grandpa drove them north, following the driving instructions he'd printed out from the internet. Soon they'd found the location: a big field in back of an abandoned factory. Its high windows were dark, and it was apparent that no one worked there any more. They hoped no one would see them digging. \u201cI'll go scope out the geography,\u201d Mike said quickly, \u201cwhile the three of you park the car.\u201d He hopped out before anyone said anything, and Grandpa looked for a hidden parking spot. Bobby stared after Mike, wondering if he was going to steal their treasure. As soon as the car stopped, they ran to the field. It was nothing but a giant patch of dirt, at least an acre-wide, and they saw Mike bending over a deep hole towards the center. \u201cSomeone's been digging!\u201d Mike shouted. Grandpa arrived last, carrying the four shovels, and became furious when he came upon the emptiness of the hole. \u201cDid they beat us to the treasure?\u201d Ann asked. Grandpa studied the hole intently. But then he began laughing and dancing. \u201cThis hole isn't deep enough!\u201d he said. \u201cMy grandfather said the treasure was buried six feet down, and this hole is only four feet deep. The treasure's still down there, waiting for us!\u201d Everyone stared thoughtfully for a moment before they grabbed shovels and started digging. The kids dug with an unearthed adrenaline for the rest of the afternoon. Grandpa\u2019s arthritis made it nearly impossible for him to break the surface of the hardened dirt, but his excitement matched the others, and maybe even exceeded it. He continued to cheer and chant until Bobby struck something. It was a pouch with the faded letters, \u201cS.S. Charleston,\u201d branded into the leather. Below the pouch were several layers of something brittle and crumbly, like buried rubber. Grandpa, Mike, and Ann found more in every direction \u2015 for several feet. But there was nothing else but dirt. Had someone gotten here before them and stolen the treasure? As the sun set on the four treasure hunters, Bobby suddenly announced that, not only did he know where the treasure was, he knew who'd been lying. Who stole the treasure?\nAnswer:","targets":["\u201cDid Mike double-cross us, and dig the holes himself?

He stared at each in turn, waiting to see if anyone was intimidated. That would certainly be a disqualification. Anyone who was intimidated by plush surroundings would certainly not be up to the task of murder. And certainly, such a person would not be up to killing Sherlock Holmes! It had taken Moriarty a lot of time to arrive at his decision. As with any businessman, Moriarty allowed for some losses\u2014spoilage or shelf time, if you will. But crimes, which were detected, and thus unsuccessful, were an unacceptable risk when your business was masterminding the majority of crimes in London. And the fact that it was inevitably Sherlock Holmes who, along with his sidekick Dr. Watson, spoiled Moriarty\u2019s crimes meant that the problem was localized. Get rid of Sherlock Holmes, and the problem was solved. The question was how to go about it. Moriarty could, of course, undertake the task himself. However, his rule had always been to have some underling, well-trained and briefed, commit the actual crime. That created a very public deniability for Moriarty himself, who could always produce many eyewitnesses to show, if the police inquired about his whereabouts, that on the night of the robbery or murder, he had been at Covent Garden enjoying the music, or was having supper at Simpson\u2019s on the Strand. It was a proven formula which had worked more than once. All the more reason to have someone else kill Holmes. But that was no reason to be careless in his preparations. Moriarty had decided not to let the men see one another, so that each would know as little as possible about his plan. Clearly only the man who measured up would be chosen for the job, but that didn\u2019t mean there should be eyewitnesses to the actual selection. That would be inviting trouble. No, Professor Moriarty would interview each man in turn, give each a week to prove himself, and then after the selection, make a final arrangement to see the selected assassin and complete arrangements.\n \nThe four men he had chosen to meet were Herman Houlihan, Ed the Bludgeoner, Morris the Ascot Dandy, and Fastidious Fred Fielder. There had been several criteria for this selection. First, none of the men was generally known in London. Scotland Yard did have its informants throughout the islands, but police detection was not yet a very exact or national science, and it was possible for a criminal to be relatively unknown far from his usual haunts. And each of the four, Professor Moriarty had it on good authority, was an experienced murderer. Each man was called in separately, and during the interview Moriarty informed the candidate that he was under consideration for a murder in London which would pay very well, indeed. He then mentioned the name of the potential victim, Sherlock Holmes, and was pleased that of the four, two men, Herman Houlihan of County Wicklow, Ireland, and Ed the Bludgeoner, recently of Glasgow, had not even heard of the famous consulting detective. It was a point in their favor that neither Morris the Ascot Dandy nor Fastidious Fred Fielder, who both knew Holmes by reputation, wanted to back down. \u201cIt\u2019ll make things easier for all of us when Holmes is gone,\u201d Morris said. The four men were asked to study Holmes carefully, and form a plan for his removal from earthly concerns. It was now Sunday evening, and each would have one allotted day to shadow the man personally, and the rest of the week to formulate his plan. They understood now that it was a competition for the murder assignment, and each undertook the task with some enthusiasm. They would return to Professor Moriarty\u2019s quarters at stated intervals the following Saturday. The following Saturday night, Ed the Bludgeoner had the first appointment, and came into the study. Ed was a Scotsman of massive build, whose weapon of choice was, as his nickname announced, the bludgeon. He preferred direct action to prolonged analysis. He said that he had spotted Holmes immediately that Monday on Baker Street. He had seen Holmes striding purposely towards 221B, carrying a surgeon\u2019s bag and puffing a bit, as though his physical condition was not at the absolute peak. Ed made up his mind quickly, and was resolute once decided. He had spotted an alley about a block and a half from Holmes\u2019 apartment. He noticed that Holmes always followed this route. It would be an easy matter, some night when the fog was dense, to waylay him as he passed the alley. One sound crack with the trusty bludgeon should do the job. Ed the Bludgeoner offered a hideous grin, pleased with his own plan. Next came Herman Houlihan. He had observed Holmes closely on Tuesday, and had even shadowed him around London. It was clear to Houlihan that Holmes was on a case, so single-minded did the detective seem. He barely smiled at those he met, and he appeared preoccupied with a woman. Houlihan was close enough at one point to hear Holmes mention a name, Irene Adler. Holmes even seemed somewhat melancholy. This must be the love that got away. Since he was so susceptible, Herman Houlihan\u2019s plan was clear and virtually suggested itself. \u201cIt will only be necessary to find an attractive young woman, winsome if I can find a good Irish lass, to beguile the great detective and lure him to a spot where my knife will do the rest.\u201d As an admirer of feminine charm himself, Houlihan was convinced that he could find the right woman to act as a lure for Holmes. Fastidious Fred Fielder, the next man, was thoughtful. He knew Holmes by reputation, had heard that he enjoyed fine violin music, and had even seen him at concerts, a pastime that he shared with the great detective. \u201cMore than once,\u201d Fielder added, \u201cI\u2019ve seen Holmes at a concert after he has solved a crime. And on Wednesday, whilst passing 221B Baker Street where Holmes\u2019 flat was located, Fielder was convinced that he had heard the violin being played somewhere within the building. \u201cAnd quite well, too,\u201d he added. \u201cNot everyone can play Paganini\u2019s great violin concerto!\u201d Fielder had consulted the concert schedule for London appearances, and had discovered that Sarasate would be playing the following week. His plan was to send Holmes tickets to the concert, and then to have an usher produce a message to Holmes at intermission, summoning him to an urgent case. \u201cI will have prepared carefully what comes next,\u201d Fielder added. Morris the Ascot Dandy entered. He was very well dressed, as his nickname implied. He said that he had seen Holmes on Thursday, and was surprised that such a famous man wore such informal clothes. \u201cWe can appeal to his sense of vanity,\u201d Morris said. \u201cTake that deerstalker cap for example, that he always wears. He would look much smarter with a black bowler hat, like a banker. We\u2019ll send him an appointment for a free hat fitting, and then take care of him when he leaves the shop\u2014Holmes won\u2019t be able to resist!\u201d Professor Moriarty thought for a moment, and then decided which of the four men he would choose to rid himself of his famous enemy. Who is the murderer?\nAnswer:","targets":["Each of the four men had observed Sherlock Holmes\u2014or thought he did.\nHowever, Ed the Bludgeoner actually shadowed Dr. Watson, who carries a surgeon\u2019s bag. His plan would have him bludgeoning Watson, not Holmes!\nMorris the Ascot Dandy observed that Holmes wears an informal cap. However, he is wrong in thinking that Holmes would want any other, more formal hat. He confuses his own vanity in matters of clothing with Holmes, who has none. His plan would be laughed off by the great detective.\nHerman Houlihan is correct that Holmes admired Irene Adler greatly. But Irene was the only woman who he admired; a plan to lure Holmes to his death using another woman\u2014no matter how fetching\u2014would certainly fail.\nFastidious Fred Fielder is correct that Holmes enjoys fine music, and might well be tempted to attend a violin concert. He is therefore the only man to put forward a scheme which might succeed, and is Professor Moriarty\u2019s choice to murder Holmes.\nWe will soon see whether his plan succeeds or not."],"multiple_choice_targets":[],"multiple_choice_scores":[],"idx":174,"is_generated":false,"true_idx":174},{"inputs":"Story: Captain John Prescott rode his horse hard through the night, coming upon the Boar's Head Tavern on the edge of Boston just before dawn. Exhausted and hungry, he dismounted and handed the reins to a stable boy who stood waiting. \u201cWill you be awhile, sir? Shall I have the horse brushed and fed?\u201d the boy asked. \u201cYes, yes, that's a good lad.\u201d Captain Prescott smiled at the boy. \u201cCare for her well and there will be an extra shilling in it for you.\u201d \u201cAye, sir!\u201d the boy said cheerfully. He led the captain's horse around to the stables and began using a currycomb to loosen the mud collected on the mare's coat. Captain Prescott rubbed a hand over his weary face, then turned and entered the Boar's Head Tavern. A fire burned low in the hearth, and next to it stood a hardback chair with a plush seat. Captain Prescott sighed as he gratefully sank into the chair. It had been over two days since he'd last slept, and he'd just come from the Battle of Bunker Hill. He'd lost a great deal of men, but not as many as the British had, and now he'd been dispatched to deliver a secret message to General Washington. \u201cExcuse me, sir, may I help you?\u201d came a voice from the other side of the room. Captain Prescott stood up quickly. \u201cAre you the owner of this establishment?\u201d \u201cIndeed I am sir,\u201d the man replied. \u201cThe name's Thomas Murray.\u201d \u201cI'm Captain John Prescott of the Continental Army. I've heard rumors that your loyalties lie with the colonies; is this true?\u201d \u201cYes sir it is,\u201d said Mr. Murray. \u201cI want nothing to do with those lobster backs or King George. You won't find any of them \u2018round here.\u201d \u201cUnfortunately that may not be true for long,\u201d said Captain Prescott. \u201cWord is the British are planning to lay siege to Boston. I've stopped here only for a short rest and a light meal, if you would be so kind.\u201d \u201cOf course, captain! I'll have my wife Eliza fix you something right away. Terrible news, just terrible,\u201d Mr. Murray said, shaking his head. Captain Prescott sat back down while Mr. Murray called for his wife. Mrs. Murray came out shortly, holding a plate of cold cornbread and salted pork. \u201cCaptain,\u201d she said, holding out the plate for him, \u201cI'm sorry the fare is so poor; we haven't been able to get much since all the fighting started.\u201d \u201cNot at all, my good woman, I thank you.\u201d Captain Prescott took the plate and hungrily began eating. It was the first meal he'd had since the vinegar and rice he'd eaten shortly before the battle had begun. Mr. Murray came over and handed him a mug of ale, which the captain swallowed at once. After he finished his meal, Mrs. Murray led him to a room above the tavern where he could rest. \u201cI'll go now and fetch some water for your washing. Let me know if you need anything else,\u201d she said, gently closing the door. The captain sighed deeply and removed his boots and his coat, which he placed on a chair near the bed. He noted how clean Mrs. Murray kept the room. The captain crawled onto the bed with his musket and immediately fell asleep. Sunlight was streaming in through the shutters when Captain Prescott suddenly awoke with a start. How long had he been sleeping? The captain got out of bed and went over to the washstand, where Mrs. Murray had evidently left a pitcher of water for him. He poured it into the basin and quickly washed up. Captain Prescott dried his face, and then turned to the chair where he'd left his coat. It was gone! Captain Prescott hurriedly put on his boots, grabbed his musket and ran out the door. A portly man was sitting in a chair by the fire, and Mrs. Murray was sweeping dirt from the tavern floor when the captain came running down the stairs. \u201cWho has stolen my coat?\u201d the captain demanded when he reached the bottom of the stairs. \u201cNo one sir, I assure you!\u201d said a startled Mrs. Murray. \u201cWho are you?\u201d the captain said to the man by the fire. \u201cGeorge Sanders and who are you, sir?\u201d \u201cCaptain Prescott of the Continental Army. Where do your loyalties lie?\u201d The man chuckled. \u201cWith the ale, captain, with the ale.\u201d \u201cHe means no harm, captain,\u201d said Mrs. Murray. \u201cThen tell me, woman, where is my coat!\u201d Captain Prescott said. \u201cIt's hanging over on the wall by the front door,\u201d Mrs. Murray said. Captain Prescott rushed over to where his coat hung. He hurriedly checked coat, and his heart sank as he saw one of his buttons was missing. \u201cWho dared remove my coat from my room!\u201d he demanded, gripping his musket tighter. \u201cIt was my wife, sir,\u201d said Mr. Murray, coming out of a back room. \u201cShe saw that it was in need of mending, so she patched it.\u201d Captain Prescott looked at his coat. The holes in the sleeves he'd gotten from battle were indeed mended with homespun cloth, and the coat was mostly clean, except for a smear of dirt. But the second button from the top of his coat was missing and it was a very important button. Inside the covering of the button was a tiny message that he was to deliver to General Washington, which contained sensitive information about the movement of the British. Someone had stolen it. \u201cDid she also remove my button?\u201d Captain Prescott said angrily. \u201cAre you accusing my wife of something?\u201d Mr. Murray said. \u201cYes, I am accusing your wife of the theft of personal property from a Continental soldier!\u201d Mrs. Murray began to cry. \u201cI assure you, captain, I did nothing of the sort! I merely patched your sleeves. The button was not missing when I mended your coat or I would have sewn on a new button!\u201d \u201cWell it wasn't missing before I slept! Who else has been in this tavern since that time?\u201d \u201cOnly Mr. Sanders, Ian from the stables, and us,\u201d said Mr. Murray. \u201cBring in Ian now!\u201d ordered Captain Prescott. Mr. Murray hurried out to the stable while Mrs. Murray continued to cry and sweep the floor. \u201cMr. Sanders, I demand you stand up sir!\u201d said Captain Prescott. \u201cWhat for, I've only just gotten here,\u201d answered Sanders. \u201cWhen did you arrive?\u201d asked the captain. \u201cI arrived a few minutes before you came down the stairs. I just came in for a drink, if that's all right with you.\u201d \u201cMrs. Murray, can you confirm that?\u201d Mrs. Murray nodded. Mr. Murray came back inside with Ian, who looked confused. \u201cNow then,\u201d said Captain Prescott. \u201cI demand to know where each of you were while I slept!\u201d Mrs. Murray hurried over to sweep up the new dirt Ian and Mr. Murray had tracked in. \u201cMrs. Murray, stop that sweeping!\u201d the captain bellowed. Mrs. Murray jumped, and then set the broom aside. \u201cWe'll begin with you, Mrs. Murray,\u201d said the captain. \u201cWhat were your exact activities while I rested?\u201d \u201cAfter I left you,\u201d Mrs. Murray said, sniffing, \u201cI went and fetched water from the well, then filled the pitcher in your room. I saw that your coat was a bit tattered, so I took it with me and sat mending it by the hearth.\u201d \u201cWhat did you do after that?\u201d asked Captain Prescott. \u201cAfter I finished mending the coat, I cleaned it and showed it to my husband before I hung it on the hook by the door. Then I set about preparing the cornbread for our noon meal.\u201d Captain Prescott turned to Mr. Murray. \u201cCan you confirm what she has told me?\u201d \u201cYes, sir, for the most part,\u201d answered Mr. Murray. \u201cI saw all the buttons when she was done mending your coat. Then I went in the back to see about bringing out another barrel of ale. When I brought the barrel to the bar, the coat was hanging up.\u201d \u201cAnd what were you doing the rest of the time?\u201d \u201cI was in the back, keeping the books,\u201d said Mr. Murray. Captain Prescott turned to Ian. \u201cAnd what were you doing?\u201d \u201cI looked after your horse, as you asked me to, sir,\u201d answered Ian. \u201cYou did promise me a shilling if I took good care of her. I brushed her and saw that she had some oats to eat.\u201d \u201cDid you come inside at any point, lad?\u201d asked Captain Prescott \u201cAye sir, just once, to help Mr. Murray with the barrel of ale.\u201d Prescott looked quizzically at Mr. Murray. The tavern owner nodded. \u201cAnd what did you do after that?\u201d the captain asked Ian. \u201cAfter Mr. Murray left the room I went back to the horses.\u201d \u201cWhere were you, Mrs. Murray, while Ian and Mr. Murray were moving the ale?\u201d \u201cI was sweeping up the dirt. The mud from outside is terrible, and it gets tracked all through the place. Then I went to go make the cornbread.\u201d Captain Prescott shook his head. There were only four people who could have stolen the button. The captain held his coat and studied it. Suddenly, he knew who it was.

It will be murder next and it will be me that gets murdered. I am to be knifed in my bed before you think to investigate properly.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s not much for me to investigate,\u201d Gregson said. \u201cEvery day you put a scarecrow out on your estate and every night he gets viciously sabotaged.\u201d \u201cYou admit it then!\u201d The old man shrieked. \u201cYou admit it\u2019s a sabotage!\u201d \u201cThe damage was certainly done with a knife of some kind. The tears are not the ragged kind I\u2019d expect to see if a wild animal had done this.\u201d \u201cProbably a gang.\u201d \u201cMr. Forbes, please. If you can give me some facts then do so, but leave the theorizing to the official forces,\u201d said Inspector Gregson. Mr. Forbes muttered something under his breath about the theories of the official forces. Inspector Gregson decided it was best to pretend he hadn\u2019t heard. He wondered if the old man could have concocted this bizarre case himself in order to get some publicity for his business. Over in the courtyard, Gregson spotted the butler, a skinny but wiry man with an extremely sour expression on his face. \u201cMy superior told me you actually saw this supposed gang last night.\u201d Gregson said, continuing his discussion with Forbes. \u201cThat\u2019s right. I heard the sound of tearing cloth and looked out of my bedroom window.\u201d \u201cHow many were there?\u201d \u201cWell, I couldn\u2019t rightly say. My eyesight isn\u2019t what it was, but I could make out some commotion in the vicinity of the scarecrow. Whoever it was certainly made a brutal attack. The scarecrow came apart as though it were made of paper, destroyed completely in seconds by the ferocious attack.\u201d The attack had certainly been ferocious, the inspector mused. Not only had the scarecrow's clothes been cut up, but the stick propping it up had been cut clean through. \u201cIt was then that I phoned the police,\u201d Mr. Forbes said, dramatically. According to his superior, Mr. Forbes had called the police the previous night to report another attack in progress. Gregson had volunteered for the job. The idea of a psychopath incensed at scarecrows to the point of manically ripping them to shreds had been rather appealing to him, at least compared with spending Friday afternoon filling out dreary paperwork. The more time he spent with Mr. Forbes, however, the more he regretted not being back at the station. \u201cWhy not just stop putting a scarecrow out?\u201d Gregson asked. \u201cWhat?! Let them win? I have a business to run here. People come to look around the house. My grandfather was a great explorer and we have some of his things here for visitors to see. There is an amusing idea that he hid treasure somewhere on the grounds. Besides, if I stop putting out a scarecrow, what\u2019s to say it won\u2019t provoke whoever is doing this? What\u2019s to say they won\u2019t come after me that very night?\u201d \u201cAll right, all right,\u201d the inspector said wearily, as he raised his hands to stop the tirade. \u201cI\u2019d like to speak to the other people in your household: the cook, the maid and the butler.\u201d The maid, Annie, was a shy girl of twenty who was working at the house for the summer. She gave Gregson the impression that she wasn\u2019t much relishing her job and was outspoken in her dislike of Mr. Forbes. Gregson wondered if Annie would take such extreme measures to frighten her boss. When Gregson questioned her, she told him that she had been too frightened to sleep the previous night. She had tried to calm her nerves by pacing her room and had occasionally glanced out the window towards the figure of the scarecrow. \u201cI felt ever so sorry for him, sir, the poor scarecrow all alone out there in the night. And then the slasher came.\u201d \u2018You saw someone!\u2019 The inspector exclaimed. \u201cNot clearly, but I saw a single figure cross the field from the house. The person prowled along, very agile, like a cat, and darted from one shrubbery and potted plant to another, as if trying to stay hidden. When the figure got up to the scarecrow, he \u2013 or she, I suppose \u2013 seemed to attack it. Then I saw the gleam of a knife, shining silver in the moonlight. It was dreadful.\u201d \u201cDo you recall the time when you saw the slasher?\u201d \u201cYes, I had looked at the clock just before I looked out the window. It was twenty minutes past eleven.\u201d This matched exactly the time that his superior had said Mr. Forbes had called in the crime. Gregson went to the ground floor to interview the cook, a woman named Mrs. Avery. She met him as he was approaching the kitchens. She had a bad limp that seemed to encumber her movement to a great extent. To the inspector\u2019s surprise, Mrs. Avery produced a large set of keys from her pocket and unlocked the door. \u201cYou lock the house kitchen?\u201d Gregson asked. \u201cI have to, sir. The butler has taken it into his head to help himself to provisions and I can\u2019t baby-sit him as well as run this house. I can barely keep up with the work. The maid is too flighty and feeble to even help me with the washing let alone any of the heavy work. The butler seems more interested in loitering in here, probably trying to pinch food, than doing any real work. I even have to make up the scarecrow, only to have it ripped to shreds every night. As if I don\u2019t have enough to do already.\u201d \u201cPhilips doesn't look like a man with a large appetite,\u201d the inspector said, laughing. \u201cPerhaps he is developing one.\u201d \u201cDeveloping, Mrs. Avery? How long have you had to lock him out like this?\u201d \u201cFour days, sir. I remember exactly because he started up this silly behaviour when I sorted out the attic for old clothes to put on that wretched scarecrow. You can see the spare ones over there in the corner.\u201d The inspector nodded. \u201cThank you, Mrs. Avery. That will be all. Please tell Mr. Philips I wish to see him now.\u201d Mrs. Avery left while Inspector Gregson squatted down and rooted through the spare clothes. After a few moments, he drew his hand out from the pile and wrapped around his fingers was a beautiful, glittering necklace.\u201d \u201cWhy do you need to see me?\u201d The butler snapped from the doorway. \u201cI was hoping that you could answer some questions for me,\u201d Gregson said. \u201cHave you seen or heard anything relating to these scarecrow slashings that could shed some light on the matter?\u201d \u201cSeen nothing, heard nothing,\u201d came the curt reply. \u201cWhere were you last night between eleven o'clock and midnight?\u201d The inspector asked. \u201cSleeping in my bed, like any decent person. Is that against the law?\u201d \u201cNot at all,\u201d Gregson said. \u201cAnd may I ask what has caused your recent increase in appetite? An appetite so intense, it seems, that Mrs. Avery felt it necessary to lock you out of the kitchen?\u201d The butler's face became a scowl. \u201cHigh and mighty Mrs. Avery. She locks the kitchen because she can. She has a petty position of power and enjoys lording it over me.\u201d \u201cWell, thank you for your co-operation,\u201d the inspector said, dryly. \u201cPerhaps it will interest you to know that I have reached my conclusion as to the identity of the scarecrow slasher.\u201d Who is the scarecrow slasher?\nAnswer:","targets":["\u201cI knew it had to be someone in the house, since the figure of the slasher was seen to cross the field to the scarecrow from the direction of the house,\u201d Gregson explained. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t have been Mr. Forbes because he was on the phone with the police when the slasher was spotted by the maid. The maid also told me that the figure was very agile, which rules out the cook; with her bad leg her movement is cumbersome at best.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy believe everything Annie says?\u201d The butler snapped. \u201cShe could have done it!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Inspector Gregson. \u201cMrs. Avery told me that Annie can barely help with the household chores. If she cannot lug piles of sheets around, I doubt that she has the strength to hack scarecrows to pieces with a blade, and she certainly can\u2019t cut wooden poles clean through.\n\n\u201cIt's also extraordinary that your sudden burst of appetite started the day of the first scarecrow incident. It\u2019s quite clear to me, Philips, that you wanted to get the scarecrow\u2019s clothes, or rather something in the clothes, since you destroyed them in the process of searching them.\u201d\n\nGregson held up the sparkling necklace for Philips to see.\n\nPhilips wrung his hands together. \u201cI\u2019ve not harmed anyone,\u201d he wailed. \u201cIt has often been suggested that the old master of the house concealed something of great value within these walls. Over the years I\u2019ve searched for it and then all of a sudden Mrs. Avery found those old clothes to use for the scarecrow, I\u2019d have looked through them in my own time but she locked me out of the kitchen. I knew that if I destroyed the scarecrows she\u2019d have to make new ones and gradually I\u2019d be able to search all the clothes.\u201d\n\nPhilips hid his face behind his hands and his shoulders started to shake.\n\n\u201cNow Philips,\u201d the Inspector said gently. \u201cI suggest you tell Mr. Forbes that you discovered the necklace during your round of duties and so return it to its rightful owner. If you are yearning for extra funds, I suggest that you write a book. A first-hand account of the terrifying attacks of the Scarecrow Slasher will certainly not be left to gather dust on the shelves.\u201d"],"multiple_choice_targets":[],"multiple_choice_scores":[],"idx":52,"is_generated":false,"true_idx":52},{"inputs":"Story: In the distance Abigail could hear gunfire from muskets and cannons. She did not shudder any more: these noises had become a way of life around the little town. Her father and two older brothers had joined the Continental Army as soon as the British had fired on Lexington. Many of the farmers and their sons from the small town had joined the ranks and left the women, children and elderly men to fend for themselves. But they had to fight for their freedom. Abigail's father had been a minister, in charge of a secret which he told Abigail one night before he left. Up the long flight of stairs he had taken her to the bell tower atop the assembly hall. Behind the locked door he told her were barrels of gunpowder and boxes of ammunition. Taking her gently in his arms, he told her to keep the secret. \u201cI'm counting on you to watch it for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI know you are young, but we all must do our part in the war. I and General George Washington are counting on you.\u201d \u201cI will keep it safe for both of you,\u201d she responded. But that had been weeks ago, and still the army had not come for their ammunition. Abigail alone had the key that would open the great lock on the door. She could not tell anyone. The rest of town was comprised of Tories that would try to take the supply away if they knew, so she did not tell anyone, not even her mother, lest someone overhear them. Only she would ring the bell to call the congregation to assemble. Alone, Abigail worried every time a thunderstorm rolled into the area. Would lightning strike the steeple? Shuddering, Abigail would try to push the thought away. She must not think like that. The day progressed slowly, the same as every Friday before had. They scrubbed the floors in the house and assembly hall, while Henry, a local drunk, kept himself busy fixing things around the house and hall. A Tory, Henry had worked for Mr. Smith in his locksmith shop before he had been fired for missing several workdays. His wife and young daughter had fallen ill and Henry had been unable to pay for a doctor \u2013 on the low pay he received \u2013 to travel to see them. Since there was no doctor nearby, his family died. He then turned to the bottle to forget, also upset at himself for not having asked for help. He let pride get in the way of his loved ones\u2019 lives, but he really blamed Mr. Smith. Abigail's thoughts turned to Mr. Smith. Besides also being a Tory, Mr. Smith was a locksmith. This had always puzzled Abigail, since there was no high demand for a locksmith in the small town. Mr. Smith was the wealthiest man in town. However, because of Abigail's father's stand on the war, he refused to set foot in the assembly hall, never having been in there, to Abigail's knowledge. Later that Friday afternoon, Mr. Samuel paid a visit to Abigail and her mother. Mr. Samuel was the only other man besides Abigail's father who knew about the location of the ammunition. He had bought the supply and instructed her father to hide it for him. He looked knowingly at her, and she curtly nodded her head in acknowledgment. All was in order; she had checked the supply earlier that morning and would do so again before bed. He acknowledged her reply. \u201cGood day Miss Abigail,\u201d he stiffly bowed, his old body riddled with arthritis. Although dusty and tired from all the cleaning, Abigail's mother invited him in for tea. However, Abigail asked her leave to finish beating the rugs free of dust. As Mr. Samuel and her mother entered the house, Abigail began to whack the rugs. A moan interrupted Abigail. She paused, trying to spot its location. Again she heard it, coming from the bottom of the hill her house sat on. Running down the hill, Abigail was concerned about the person who had made that noise. As she made it to the bottom, she saw the figure of a soldier. A Continental Army soldier was lying face down in the tall grass. \u201cOh, Dear!\u201d she cried as she knelt next to him. She turned him over, and was surprised to find the soldier was barely older than a boy. Blood oozed from a wound on his head. He was feverish and his eyes fluttered open when she supported him. \u201cDo you know a Miss Abigail?\u201d he asked, struggling to stay awake. \u201cI am she.\u201d \u201cI had a message from your father, but ... it was stolen.\u201d He raised his hand and touched his head. \u201cSomeone hit me and stole the message.\u201d \u201cOh, dear!\u201d Abigail said again, unsure of what to do next. \u201cYou need help, but we have to be careful,\u201d she warned him, \u201cThe town is full of Tories. Can you stand and walk if I help support you?\u201d The boy nodded, still winching from the pain. Abigail helped him to his feet and pulled his arm over her shoulder. Slowly they walked up the hill. Abigail kept a close watch on both the house and the town beyond them. They must not be seen! Once inside the assembly hall, she lowered the boy down on a pew. \u201cI'll be back with some food,\u201d she promised, hurrying from the room. Running to the kitchen, she grabbed some bread and milk as well as bandages and water for the boy's wound. He ate ravenously while she bandaged his wound. Afterward, she retired to bed. She slept fitfully, feeling she had forgotten something. A sound awoke her and she remembered. The ammunition in the tower had been forgotten. Silently she slipped out of her bed and grabbed the key that lay on the table near her bed. Not willing to light a candle, she felt her way to the tower in total darkness. Up the long stairwell, and into the lock she fitted the key. As she turned the knob, a hand reached out of the darkness and grabbed her. She tried to scream and struggle, but the voice reassured her it was all right. It was the solder, so she relaxed. \u201cWhat are you doing up here?\u201d he inquired, releasing her from his grasp. Shuffling her feet, Abigail wondered what to answer. He must not know about the ammunition, or he would have told her, but she must not tell a lie. Quickly the boy acted, he pushed open the door, and walked in. Abigail was worried and followed, but to her surprise all the ammunition was gone! The barrels and boxes she had worried and kept watch over were gone! \u201cIs something missing,\u201d the soldier asked of her. \"Yes...but I know who took it.\" Who stole the ammunition?\nAnswer:","targets":["\u201cWho?\u201d asked the soldier.\n\n\u201cOnly three men and knew about the supply of ammunition stored here,\u201d Abigail explained. \u201cBut the locked door could have aroused suspicion.\u201d\n\nShe told the soldier about the suspects and their backgrounds. \u201cMr. Samuel is ruled out because of his arthritis: He would be unable to move the barrels, even though he knew about the gunpowder.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are ruled out too, of course, because even if you had read the message you were bringing, you wouldn\u2019t have moved the gunpowder. My father trusted you, so you are an honorable person.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, thank you,\u201d the soldier said, blushing slightly. \u201cSo it had to be Mr. Smith.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would seem so,\u201d Abigail said. \u201cHe\u2019s a Tory and a locksmith. And because my keys never left her, the lock would have had to been picked. However, Mr. Smith was being framed. As I told you, he has never set foot in the assembly hall, or climbed the tower, so he wouldn\u2019t know about the barrels, let alone the locked door.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt had to have been Henry. He\u2019s a Tory and when he saw you, a Revolutionary soldier, he hit you on the head. After he read the message, which stated the army was to pick up the ammunition next week, he decided to make plans. He was going to frame Mr. Smith to repay him. He had worked in Mr. Smith's shop, so he knew about locks, and didn't need the key I carried around. When he saw me busy tending to you, he used that time to open the door and move the barrels down to his room. Later that night when I was in bed, he moved the barrels and boxes out to the shed. That was the noise I had heard.\u201d\n\nHenry admitted to the crime and helped Abigail and the young soldier move the boxes back into the tower. Henry left soon after and traveled west, never to be heard of again.\n\nThe next week, Abigail's father came for the ammunition. He was very proud of the job she had done.\n\nNeither Abigail nor the young soldier ever told about the ammunition going missing."],"multiple_choice_targets":[],"multiple_choice_scores":[],"idx":110,"is_generated":false,"true_idx":110},{"inputs":"Story: Emerald eyes reluctantly opened at the insistent knocking. Siobhan glanced at her bedside clock, which informed the thirteen year old that it was much earlier than she had intended to rise. With school Monday through Friday, she looked forward to Saturday snoozing. \"Siobhan are you awake?\" Sitting up in the bed, the teen sifted fingers through disorderly auburn locks. \u201cCome in Mama.\u201d Only then did Siobhan notice the delicious aroma from the corned beef and cabbage her mother cooked for their small town's annual True Green Gala, which was in honor of St. Patrick's Day. Each year it was a hit and nearly everyone in town, whether Irish or not, thoroughly enjoyed participating. A potluck type of celebration, it took place at the local park and although St. Patrick's Day wasn't until Monday, the town preferred having the party during the weekend. The bedroom door opened, revealing a statuesque redhead wearing a lightly stained apron with a beaming leprechaun on it. \u201cSweetie, I need you to run an errand. Could you go to the store for a half-gallon of buttermilk? I forgot to buy it yesterday.\u201d Siobhan nodded, pushing the covers back. \u201cSure Mama.\u201d * \u201cI'll have breakfast ready when you get back,\u201d Mrs. Doyle called out from the kitchen when she heard her daughter running down the stairs, which was her usual method of getting to the main floor. She wouldn't be surprised if the girl joined the track team upon entering high school. \u201cOkay Mama!\u201d Front door shut and locked, Siobhan grabbed her bicycle and headed down the porch steps. Helmet securely attached she raced off down the quiet street. Minutes later she arrived at the best grocery store in town. Granted there weren't many grocery stores in the small community, but most deemed that Peter MacDonald's business was first rate. He always had the freshest fruits and vegetables, kept his shelves stocked and his prices reasonable. His customers adored Peter MacDonald, a kind and helpful man. Just last week Ella Walsh, one of the oldest residents in Addison, was having a terrible time with her arthritis. Peter delivered her groceries, put them away where she directed and even made her dinner. \u201cHiya, Mr. MacDonald!\u201d Siobhan said in greeting as she pushed through the glass door, the bell overhead tinkling in response. The grocer looked up from unloading canned goods from a cardboard box. \u201cMorning Siobhan.\u201d After a glance at his watch he added, \u201cYou're up early! Helping your Mama make her yummy corned beef and cabbage?\u201d She nodded. \u201cI was sent for buttermilk for the bread.\u201d Peter began to speak in a conspiratorial whisper, although the store was empty except for them. \u201cDon't tell my wife, but your mother creates the best Irish soda bread I've ever tasted.\u201d Siobhan grinned as she made her way to the refrigerator section. As she waited for Peter to count out her change, she noted that the man appeared the slightest bit glum. \"Mr. Mac?\" She folded the bills he handed her, tucking them into one of the many pockets sewn onto her verdant overalls. \u201cYes honey?\u201d \u201cAre you okay?\u201d It was on the tip of his tongue to respond with a hearty \u201cyes,\u201d but she studied him with such earnestness that he couldn't. \u201cNot really. Someone stole the pi\u00f1ata.\u201d He pointed toward the entrance. \u201cFrom my truck parked right in front of the store.\u201d Siobhan gasped. Just like her mother was known for bringing her famous corned beef and cabbage each year, Peter always supplied a shamrock pi\u00f1ata filled with circa two hundred premium chocolates and candies. \u201cWhen?\u201d \u201cI opened the store earlier than usual \u2013 about 4:30 \u2013 and I went out to my truck around six o\u2019clock and noticed that it was missing from the cargo bed. Had it under a tarp.\u201d Sighing, he drummed his fingertips on the counter. \u201cAnd this year I put something special in it. Besides candy, I inserted fifty one dollar bills stamped with a tiny shamrock.\u201d Siobhan's eyes widened. \u201cWe need to find whoever did this!\u201d This was a catastrophe. Whoever was responsible definitely was not exhibiting true green spirit! Detective persona slipping into place, Siobhan asked for a sheet of paper and a pen. \u201cSiobhan you go home. Don't worry about it. There'll be plenty of other fun activities.\u201d \u201cBut someone stole from you and I wanna know who that someone is.\u201d The next few minutes were spent with Siobhan questioning Mr. MacDonald. By the end of her mini-interrogation she didn't have much to go on, but it would have to do. Buttermilk in the basket attached to her bicycle, Siobhan straddled the seat while she reread her notes: \u201cPi\u00f1ata taken between 4:30 - 6:00 a.m. Each one-dollar bill had tiny shamrock stamped in upper right-hand corner. Doing stamping, Zach - Mr. Mac's son \u2013 is only person besides Mrs. Mac who should know about $50 in pi\u00f1ata.\u201d Siobhan's next destination, after dropping the buttermilk off at home, was the MacDonald household to have a chat with fifteen-year-old Zach, who was her friend. He wasn't supposed to tell others about the money stuffed into the pi\u00f1ata, but did he? And if he kept his mouth shut did he steal from his own father? * Although she pleaded her case, Siobhan wasn't allowed to leave until she ate her breakfast. Scarfing it down in record time, she ran upstairs to grab what she referred to as her CSI (crime scene investigation) backpack. Notepads, magnifying glasses and a handheld recorder were among the items inside. On a daily basis Siobhan dreamt of when she would become a true detective. Promising that she would return by eleven, Siobhan rode to Zach's house around the corner. According to Zach, he only went for a walk during which he met up with his friend Evan, who was out walking his two golden retrievers. Zach admitted that he told Evan and another pal named Richie about the pi\u00f1ata money. The plot thickens, Siobhan thought as she scribbled this down. \u201cHey, you wouldn\u2019t happen to have ten bucks on ya?\u201d Zach asked. He looked embarrassed. \u201cMy dad withheld my allowance because I missed a homework assignment, and I want to go to a movie.\u201d \u201cSorry, no cash on me.\u201d She thanked Zach for his time and left for the Carpenter home. Emily, Evan's younger sister, whom she had three classes with, answered the door. Her cheeks were bulging and she was holding a jar in her left hand. Emily hurriedly swallowed. \u201cSiobhan! What brings you here? I'm headed to the laundromat to wash some tablecloths for the party. You wanna go? You can pull my Radio Flyer.\u201d Emily\u2019s breath smelled like chocolate and Siobhan noticed the jar was full of quarters. \u201cI would, but I actually need to speak with your brother.\u201d Emily turned, looking toward the stairs. \u201cEVAN! DOOR!\u201d She grinned at her schoolmate. \u201cHe'll be here in a minute.\u201d \u201cThanks. Hey, you have something\u2026\u201d Siobhan tapped the corner of her mouth. \u201cOops. Dampening a finger, Emily wiped off the smudge. \u201cIt was chocolate. Candy.\" \u201cCandy?!\u201d \u201cYeah. From Valentine\u2019s.\u201d \u201cA month ago?\u201d \u201cI received a lot of boxes. My last one, finally.\u201d Emily put the jar in her red wagon, next to her mother's festive tablecloths and a box of detergent. She grasped the handle and rolled it passed the visitor. \u201cSee you at True Green?\u201d \u201cYou bet.\u201d Evan arrived at the door, appearing nothing short of quizzical. \u201cSiobhan? What's up?\u201d She explained that she was investigating the pi\u00f1ata theft and asked what he had been up to that morning. \u201cI was doing what I do every morning,\u201d he said, slightly miffed, \u201ctaking our dogs Duke and Duchess for a walk.\u201d Next Siobhan paid the Harris house a visit. Richie's father informed Siobhan that his son was busy spending his allowance at the arcade. She discovered him next to a pinball machine counting his money. \u201cHi Richie.\u201d She told him about the missing pi\u00f1ata, gauging his reaction to the news. He seemed appropriately stunned, but so had his friends. \u201cCould I see your ones?\u201d \u201cYou think I swiped it?\u201d He didn't wait for a response. \u201cHere,\u201d he said, handing her the bills.

Now she was crying on my telephone. Through the tears, I gathered the details. She'd wanted to know who'd stolen her dollhouse. The first clue was her address - a gigantic house on top of a hill, where Fiona was throwing a party. Yesterday she'd sung her newest song on television, and today she'd invited some guests to celebrate. Just 300 of her closest friends. . . Thankfully, the party hadn't begun - it was scheduled for that night. Her enormous lawn was completely empty, with nothing but perfectly trimmed grass and a driveway a half-mile long. It looked expensive, and a little lonely. An iron gate blocked the driveway's entrance, but a security guard emerged from a small shack in front. Fiona's estate was surrounded by a thick hedge of 10-foot high bushes. But could someone sneak over the hedge to steal Fiona's dollhouse? I asked the security guard, who didn't say a word. He just pointed his head towards a security console with over 30 monitors, each showing a different section of the hedge. A light blinked below one, indicating its motion detectors had registered a tiny bird landing on the hedge. Nobody could sneak in without being detected. However, there were five people already inside. When I rang Fiona's doorbell, its chimes played her famous song, and Fiona answered the door in a bright red gown. I recognized her sad face immediately as millions of people would. As she led me into the enormous room, her high-heeled shoes clicked loudly on the marble floor. \"I had my cleaning women come yesterday,\u201d she said, \"so my place could be spotless tonight.\u201d Was there any chance a cleaner could be your thief? She seemed hurt by the question. \"No,\u201d she insisted. \"So many people want to use you when you're famous. And not just for autographs. There's crooked business operatives and industry parasites. . .\u201d \"But I wouldn't let that happen to me. Even when hiring my cleaners, I chose people I could trust. They're friends I've known since childhood. Some are even members of my family.\u201d I felt bad as I started to say that you can't rule out any suspects. But then she gave me another clue. \"It couldn't have been any of them, because the dollhouse was here when I woke up this morning. Then an hour later, it was gone!\" The only thing stolen was Fiona's exotic Russian dollhouse with a lonely history all its own. Princess Katarina had received it 400 years ago, facing her own medieval parasites trying to befriend the famous. A powerful Russian lord assembled a dozen jewel-setters to decorate its eight rooms, each carved out of a rare black wood. Each room was a different color, its walls filled with gorgeous jewels - green emeralds, red rubies, and even sparkly white diamonds. Its huge financial value was matched only by its historic value. Fiona thought it was worth \"at least ten million dollars\u201d -- but she hadn't had it appraised. We cross the marble floor to a tiny den where the dollhouse had been displayed. It had no other exits or windows. Neither did the enormous room we'd just crossed, except for a kitchen on its right, and a wide staircase curling down from the second floor above. A fresh bouquet of unhappy sun-less flowers was resting on the den's floor. I called the guard's shack at the entrance to Fiona's driveway. Was there anyone else who had already left the house? No, the guard replied firmly. I replaced the phone, then told Fiona I had some bad news. \"That means the thief must be one of the four people still in your house. We'll have to figure out who could've stolen your dollhouse. Can you tell me anything about them?\" \"Well first, there's my boyfriend Kyle.\u201d I'd seen his picture in the paper. (There had been a small scandal when late one night he'd crashed his car.) Maybe the reputation he got was unfair, but just being here today also made him a suspect. Could he also be seducing the singer, in order to steal from her? Also in Fiona's house was Lucius Oswald, the chief caterer. He was well respected throughout Hollywood as a brilliant but strange servant to the stars. Lucius arrived that morning on an exotic bicycle from Sweden, and Fiona escorted him to examine the kitchen for his twenty-person catering crew, who were scheduled to arrive that afternoon. I immediately wondered if he had a side business selling the occasional stolen antique! Lucius was hired by suspect #3, a party planner named Julia. She'd become famous herself for being able to organize a party for 300 people overnight. Julia was smart, energetic, and very serious about her career, and when you hired Julia, she'd guarantee a wonderful party with the best caterer in town. But maybe she was secretly bitter after planning hundreds of parties for other people. Everyone there was a glamour-industry professional except one. His name was Reg, and he had dark eyes above thin lips that didn't smile. He acknowledged that part of him didn't even want to be here, saying he felt out of place in the houses of the rich and famous. But when Julia had seen his gorgeous bouquets, she'd insisted he be her party's florist. Reg had dutifully loaded 40 bouquets into his van to decorate all the rooms in Fiona's house. He didn't usually fill orders involving this many bouquets, and he'd obviously feel more comfortable back in his flower shop. But had he grabbed a souvenir? \"I want this solved quickly,\u201d Fiona moaned. \"So do I,\u201d snapped Julia, bringing Lucius and Reg into the room from the kitchen next door. Kyle heard their footsteps echoing across the marble floor, and came down the staircase from the second floor. He had long, glamorous hair, and wore an expensive looking shirt. Seizing the moment, I asked: who was the first person to arrive? The night before, after Fiona's television appearance, she'd had a date with Kyle. She picked him up in her famous red Ferrari and drove him back to her estate. Kyle said in a lazy voice, \"So I've been here since last night.\u201d \"I wasn't,\u201d Julia added. \"I had Reg start delivering the flowers early, and then sent Lucius over to begin preparing the kitchen.\u201d Were you in the kitchen all morning? I asked Lucius. \"A caterer has to know what kind of facilities he has,\u201d Lucius insisted defensively. I have to ask you all a very important question, I told the suspects. Was anyone here carrying anything when they arrived? \"Not me,\u201d said Kyle. \"Just one of my clipboards,\u201d said Julia. \"And your purse!\u201d Kyle challenged. \"Search it!\u201d Julia said sharply, holding her purse open for all of us to see. \"There's no Russian dollhouse in here!\" \"Julia,\u201d I said, \"I'm afraid I'm going to have to search your car.\u201d \"Go ahead!\u201d she said furiously. \"I've got nothing to hide!\" We searched Julia's car, and sure enough, we found nothing inside except another clipboard.

A great deal of gossip was available at the Martin Tea Shop, and much of it was of good value, setting the stage for Miss Marple\u2019s later, amazing deductions. That is why a fortnight away from home required her to catch up on what had happened during her absence. She could never tell when some tiny detail might later provide the evidence to solve a local mystery. Her visit in Shropshire had been interesting, and it was fun to see old friends, but now she was home again. Surprisingly, the local news was so exciting that she didn\u2019t even have to ask. Friends and neighbors sort of blurted out their versions of what had happened during her absence. She had no sooner settled in at her usual table at Martin\u2019s Tea Shop and ordered some tasty buttered scones with jam and a pot of tea, when she first heard the news. \u201cYou haven\u2019t heard? It just surprised all of us so,\u201d said Alice Wiggins, her longtime friend and bridge partner, pausing to sit down at Miss Marple\u2019s table and a bit short of breath. \u201cAnd I always thought that Elmer Tydings was honest as the day is long!\u201d Alice was louder than usual, and soon everyone in the tea shop wanted to share what they knew with Miss Marple, their local sleuth celebrity. \u201cOf course you must have heard, Jane dear, about the robbery at the church,\u201d said Tom the Postman, who was stopping by the Martin Tea Shop to deliver their mail. \u201cNobody talked about anything else for days. It must have happened, let me think, just a few days after you left for your holiday. Of course, everyone knows that Elmer didn\u2019t do it!\u201d He glared at Alice. \u201cYes indeed, Jane,\u201d added Martha Jenning, another friend, who drew up a chair to share the sense of excitement, \u201cwe have had quite a time here in St. Mary Mead.\u201d \u201cTell me all about it, Tom\u201d Miss Marple said, smiling at Alice and Martha, while leaning forward at her tea table. She knew from experience that Tom the Postman was a close observer who did not let his imagination run wild. His version would be a good place to start on this mystery, whatever it was! \n\u201cAll right, they won\u2019t mind if I just take a minute and rest my feet. Besides,\u201d he confided, \u201cthe Postmaster is gone to Salisbury for the day, so I\u2019m my own boss.\u201d He knitted his brow for a moment, wanting to make sure that he got the details right and in the correct order. He had Miss Marple\u2019s close attention and valued her good opinion. \u201cIt was the Sunday after you left, Jane. We were all at church, of course, and the Vicar had given a good sermon, not too long this time. It was most interesting. I wish I could remember what it was about.\u201d \u201cSin, most likely,\u201d Alice added helpfully. \u201cHe\u2019s always against it.\u201d Tom glowered at her for a moment, then resumed his story. \u201cIt was about the value of old traditions,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Vicar was telling us to value what we have, and he was going to use for an example the old bible that is usually kept under lock and key at the vicarage.\u201d \u201cYes, Jane,\u201d Martha added impatiently, aware that Tom always took forever to tell his stories, \u201cbut he couldn\u2019t. The bible had been stolen!\u201d \u201cNot the King James Version!\u201d Jane was really shocked. Their village copy consisted of fifteen separately bound pages of the original 1611 first edition. These were the fifth, sixth and seventh chapters of the Gospel according to St. Matthew, which told the story of the Sermon On The Mount. How did these pages become separated from the original bible? The legend was that a knight from the region wanted these pages always with him when he went to battle. And so this precious excerpt was separately bound as a small volume. Over the years, his family had died out, and the small volume had been left to the village church. Its value was considerable. It was the most valuable possession of the local church. For that matter, it was probably the most valuable single object in the entire village. Tom the Postman plodded on. \u201cThe Vicar announced that the bible was gone, and he added that it was such a shame. He had been going to bring it to our attention, but the fact is that it is such a valuable property, that the money it would have brought at auction would have more than paid for repairs to the church roof. For, like Shakespeare\u2019s church and last resting place at Stratford, many repairs were needed quickly, and there was just not enough money to pay for them.\u201d He shook his head firmly, showing agreement with himself. \u201cThat, of course, was the bombshell, if you see what I mean,\u201d Alice added. \u201cThe Vicar said that he had been going to consult with the entire village on the matter before the bible was put up for auction, but now, the bible and the chance to raise the necessary money, were both lost.\u201d Miss Marple\u2019s eyes narrowed, as though she was seeing something far away. \u201cDid anyone know about the Vicar\u2019s plans to sell the bible? Has an arrest been made?\u201d Tom glowered at Martha and went on. \u201cOnly four people knew about it, John and Louise Stubbs, and Elmer and Katherine Tydings,\u201d he said. Miss Marple shook her head knowingly. It was a mystery why two couples that disliked each other so much were always on committees together. Tom went on. \u201cWe found out that they disagreed about selling the bible. John and Louise Stubbs, however reluctantly, favored selling the bible. Louise Stubbs knew its value from her library work. Her husband John, who has that farm a few miles outside the village, has fingernails so dirty that he doesn\u2019t have any interest in books. Even his wife won\u2019t lend him books from the St. Mary Mead library! \u201cNow, Katherine Tydings, on the other hand, was very much opposed to selling the bible: she just wouldn\u2019t hear of it - the book must stay here. You know how strong willed she is, Jane! Of course, her husband Elmer went along with her. He always does.\u201d \u201cWhen was the bible last seen?\u201d Jane Marple wanted to know. \u201cIt was the night before the service,\u201d Tom replied. The five of them were meeting about selling the bible. The way the Vicar told it to the police, there was quite an argument.\u201d (Jane remembered that Tom\u2019s brother Frank was a patrolman on the St. Mary Mead Constabulary.) \u201cElmer Tydings was so upset, that he actually grabbed the bible and left the church. That was the last time that anyone saw the bible.\u201d \u201cIt all sounds straightforward enough,\u201d Miss Marple said. \u201cElmer is now in custody, I presume.\u201d \u201cYes indeed, on the Vicar\u2019s statement,\u201d Tom replied. \u201cBut he absolutely denies having stolen the bible. In fact, he claims that he soon thought better of things, and that it was returned later that night to the church. He and Katherine had talked it all over. He says he wrapped it carefully, and Katherine drove into town and put the book through the door slot on the side door of the church, which is used for donations of books throughout the week. He wanted to see a show on television, so Katherine drove their car into town and returned the book. \u201cKatherine corroborates his story. And there is a witness who saw her walking from her car to the church.\u201d \u201cDid Elmer know what was on television?\u201d Tom answered. \u201cYes, my brother saw the same show, and they talked about it.\u201d Was the door locked?\u201d \u201cYes, Jane. But nobody looked at the donations for hours. Nobody does until the volunteer librarian shows up. That\u2019s her job. It\u2019s Louise Stubbs, of course, and she usually spends an hour or so there in the late afternoon after she finishes cataloging the books at our local library. She doesn\u2019t recall seeing the book. As a matter of fact, Louise says she had nearly a sleepless night after that scene at the church meeting, falling asleep so late that she didn\u2019t even go to the church after she finished work at the town library.\u201d \u201cWho knew,\u201d Miss Marple wanted to know, \u201caside from Elmer and Katherine Tydings, that the book had been returned?\u201d \u201cJust the Vicar himself, it seems. He was telephoned by Katherine the night the bible was taken. He promised that if the book was returned, he would not press charges against Elmer. But he had an emergency to attend to and didn\u2019t make it into church until late the following afternoon. With no bible, he called the police and gave them a statement. They have detained Elmer.\u201d \u201cWhat an interesting thing to happen in our little town,\u201d Miss Marple observed. \u201cI\u2019ll have a little chat with the Vicar. He clearly thought he was doing the right thing. I hope he won\u2019t be too embarrassed if I have to tell him the wrong person has been arrested!\u201d Who stole the bible?\n  choice: John Stubbs\n  choice: Louise Stubbs\n  choice: Elmer Tydings\n  choice: Katherine Tydings\nAnswer:","targets":["Katherine Tydings"],"multiple_choice_targets":["Elmer Tydings","John Stubbs","Katherine Tydings","Louise Stubbs"],"multiple_choice_scores":[0,0,1,0],"idx":154,"is_generated":false,"true_idx":374},{"inputs":"Story: Tim, the led investigator of the crash looks over the recovered wreckage. There is hardly anything to lead him to a conclusion. All the bodies show no sign of injuries and there are bones that were broken after the plane hit the water. Valerie, one of his colleagues is analysing a chunk of the door. It is charred at the edges and there is a shaving razor imbedded in to it. 'Tim, look at this. The razor should have broken but it is intact. The comb belongs to a flight attendant because no one else was sitting near enough to the door', Valerie says. I step away from the table and approach Tim and Valerie to study the evidence. It is one of the most intriguing pieces of wreckage that we recovered. No one knows why or how the razor was able to be imbedded. The force of the impact would have shattered it. 'Where was the chunk of door found?' I say nervously. I was new here and I didn't want to make myself look like I was inexperienced (although I was). I spoke as little as possible and would not touch the evidence when absolutely necessary. 'Very close to land. Only half a kilometre away'. Valerie replied. Tim wouldn't speak to me. He's never been happy when a new person comes in Valerie told me. That night, after watching Tim lock up the warehouse securely to stop intruders, I started to do some of my own work as to what happened to that mysterious section of door. Working from photographs I had secretly taken earlier, I noticed that there was some text on the white and cleaner side. After orientating the evidence, I found that the scorch marks were coming from above. There had been a fire on the ceiling. The next day, I was working with a new group of investigators. Emma, Mary and Peter. Tim was, as usual, tucked away somewhere. I talked to Emma about my findings and she was shocked. This changed the entire approach to the investigation. We talked to Tim who reluctantly agreed to investigate the fire possibility. I was overjoyed. Emma was not. Emma was always the most fun and chatty person to work with. She also was the most experienced out of our team. She looked very funny because of her completely shaven hair. She had become increasingly upset. Her husband had died just after the plane crash but she had never told anyone how he died. Mary and Peter, like me, had recently joined and didn't take the work seriously enough. Soon afterwards, Mary went home and left for her one week vacation. I told Peter about the my fire idea and Peter agreed with me but only because he had absolutely no skills whatsoever. Tim didn't trust him and never told him anything that the others didn't know. His access was restricted and he was not given the passcode We continued with our work and found nothing else to form a new theory. It seemed that I was right. That night, I watched Tim lock up again and returned home. I arrived at the warehouse and was greeted by looks of shock and dismay. Vital evidence had been stolen and the door with the scorch marks was among the stolen things. The thief must have been an insider because no one outside knew about the fire theory. After my lunch break, I returned to the warehouse downhearted. Emma, who I was closest to, was leaving for a better paying job elsewhere. At the end of the month, she would be gone. Before I left work that day, I heard a clatter in the warehouse and told Tim to keep the doors open for me to investigate. At the back of the warehouse I found Mary snooping around and looking at the paper records. I shouted at her and she ran. We did not see her again for half a week. Mary couldn't have tampered with the evidence, could she? She did not have authorisation to open the cabinets they were stored in anyway and but did know the passcode. She didn't have a motive we knew about anyway. I spent the next week thinking about the case and Mary. She eventually returned and we didn't speak. I was the only one to know who was in the warehouse. I took a phone call for Valerie and an on site investigator had made some discoveries. Someone had found some other piece of burning wreckage and thrown it out to sea. A villager had been bribed by an unknown person to discard the burning wreckage and not tell anyone about it. There was a body and a pack of cigarettes found very nearby, in the sea and it was Emma's husband's body. He was a flight attendant whose body had very high levels of carbon monoxide. That was what had happened to him. But the identification of the body made no difference to the case. We had confirmed that there was a fire which went undetected. Bodies had higher levels of carbon monoxide. They had been poisoned by the fire and died before the plane hit the ground. And in a flash, I knew who had sabotaged the investigation.

Until he saw Matthew come charging across their front lawn and out into the street. Then he yelped and jumped off the still rolling bike and ran off in the opposite direction as fast as his little legs would carry him. \u201cHow\u2019d he get the bike unchained from your garage?\u201d David asked, once he and String had caught up with Matthew in the middle of the street. \u201cThe punk\u2019s crafty,\u201d Matthew scowled, stroking the dust off his bike with a Kleenex. The boys mounted up and peddled on over to the city park. Cory was waiting for them at the entrance to the park, sitting on his own customized bike. \u201cI got a real rough track picked out for you squirts today,\u201d he said.

They hit the trails, bouncing up and down a set of ruts that led through the forest, peddling hard up one side of a hill and then sailing down the opposite side, yelling with excitement. They crossed a bumpy crushed rock road and rattled along an abandoned railway track before speeding over a cedar chip path back into a wooded area, laughing and shouting. David, Cory and Matthew raced out ahead of String, flying around a corner in the path and out of sight. The beanpole made no effort to keep up. A minute later, he heard a horrific scream. String sped around the corner and skidded to a stop. Matthew was sprawled out on the ground, David off his bike and kneeling next to the whimpering boy. \u201cMy front wheel came off!\u201d Matthew wailed. He let David help him to his feet, nothing injured except his brand-new bike and his pride. Cory squatted down beside the busted bicycle and picked up two shiny metal nuts. They were the axle nuts that secured the front wheel to the front forks of the bike, and when they\u2019d come off, the wheel had come free, pitching Matthew right over the handlebars and onto the trail. \u201cThese babies must\u2019ve been deliberately loosened, to fly off a new bike like that,\u201d Cory said. \u201cLucky you weren\u2019t riding down a hill or something \u2013 you could\u2019ve really been hurt.\u201d \u201cSabotage!\u201d Matthew cried. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t one of your stupid practical jokes, was it?\u201d David asked String. String scratched his bony skull. \u201cWhat, and miss it? What\u2019s the point of a practical joke if you don\u2019t see it happen?\u201d \u201cWas anyone fooling around with your bike before you came here, Matthew?\u201d Cory asked. Matthew sniffled, brushing off his jeans and t-shirt. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think \u2026\u201d An angry gleam suddenly shone in his watery brown eyes. \u201cYeah, wait a minute-\u201d \u201cWait a minute, indeed,\u201d String interrupted. He walked over to Cory and popped the axle nuts out of the boy\u2019s hand and deftly caught them in his own hand. \u201cI know who loosened these,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we all know why.\u201d Who sabotaged the bike?\nAnswer:","targets":["\u201cYeah, it was my stupid little brother, Mark!\u201d Matthew blurted. \u201cWe caught him riding around on my bike before we left \u2013 remember?\u201d\n\n\u201cI remember,\u201d String replied. \u201cBut would the kid be riding a bike with a loosened front wheel \u2013 if he knew about it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I guess even he\u2019s not that dumb,\u201d Matthew reluctantly agreed. He glared at String. \u201cBut what about this practical joke business?\u201d\n\n\u201cI already explained that away. I would have made sure that I kept up to see it happen if I had known about it.\u201d String explained again. \u201cPlus, I make sure my jokes could never actually hurt anyone, like this stunt could\u2019ve.\u201d\n\nMatthew fingered Cory next. \u201cWhat about this guy? He picked the trails \u2013 took us down all those bumpy paths that were sure to jolt my loose wheel right off. Plus, he\u2019s resented my new bike from the start!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all resented your attitude about the new bike,\u201d String stated. \u201cNot letting any of us ride it. But Cory wasn\u2019t at your house to do the dirty deed. He was already here waiting for us in the park.\u201d\n\nString paused dramatically. \u201cBut one other person was at your house, had the opportunity to commit the crime, along with the motivation. Not to mention the weapon \u2013 the tools from your own garage. Right \u2026 David?\u201d\n\nThe redhead\u2019s freckled face burned a guilty shade of crimson. \u201cWell \u2026 Matthew was being such a knob about his new bike and all. I-I just wanted to teach him a lesson.\u201d\n\nMatthew sighed and walked over to his upended bicycle. \u201cLesson taught,\u201d he conceded. \u201cNow, c\u2019mon and help me fix my bike, and I\u2019ll let you all ride it.\u201d"],"multiple_choice_targets":[],"multiple_choice_scores":[],"idx":146,"is_generated":false,"true_idx":146},{"inputs":"Story: This is the story of how I solved the mystery of the stolen green pearls. I got involved for two reasons: first, it was my family's jewelry store that was robbed just a few days before St. Patrick's Day; and second, the local teachers were in conference, so I didn't have to go to school. Anyway, the thief only took one thing: a string of green pearls that was going on display during our town's St. Patrick's Day celebration. The mayor asked us if we would keep the necklace safe. After all, we had great security for a small store: alarms, cameras, and our night guards, Tom and Earl, and Earl's Jack Russell terrier, Rufus. My Dad told me the police had narrowed the list of suspects to four people: Tom, Earl, Robert \u2013 the armored car driver \u2013 and Christopher, the last employee to leave on the night of the robbery. The police questioned all four but couldn't find any evidence to charge any of them with the crime. It had to be one of them, though, because no one else could get by our security. I mean, there\u2019s only one entry to the store and it had an alarm that would go off if opened. Each window had alarms on them, too. The only entryway not alarmed was Rufus' doggy door, but there was an outside camera that kept watch on that. Dad also had an x-ray scanner that all employees had to go through after each shift so that nothing could be smuggled out in a bag or in their clothing. If that wasn't enough, Rufus wasn't allowed to wear a dog collar to work, in case he got any crazy ideas. No alarms were set off the night of the robbery. The videos of the outside of the building looked normal and the x-ray scans showed that no one had taken out anything they shouldn't have. In place of the real pearl necklace, a fake glass one was left behind. The store was searched from top to bottom, but no trace of the real pearls was found. I decided to conduct my own investigation, since it seemed the police had given up. I started with Tom, the first night watchman. He comes in at 6 p.m. According to him, nothing special happened the night of the robbery. He said Christopher, the sales clerk, was checking on the necklace when he arrived. Tom said he went in to look at it and to help Christopher count up the bank deposit (which he often did). When Robert, the armored car driver, arrived, Christopher asked Tom to put the necklace away for him. After Tom finished that, he went back to work counting up the money with Christopher. Afterward, Tom locked the front door behind Christopher and Robert and went to his favorite chair in the lunchroom where the outside camera monitor is kept. Every hour after that he made a lap around the inside of the store: first to the front where all the less expensive jewelry is kept and then to the back of the showroom where the most expensive things are. At about 10:00 p.m. he ate dinner \u2013 his famous meatloaf (famously disgusting). He then went back to work until Earl (and Rufus) arrived at 1:30 a.m. Tom and Earl both went into the office and checked on the pearl necklace. Earl scanned him through the x-ray machine and Tom went home. (I went over to the scanner and looked up the scan for that night; there was no sign of any pearls on the scan saved in the machine.) Next I waited to talk to Earl. Tom had to wake me up at 1:30 a.m. when Earl came to work. He showed me the cabinet where the pearl necklace was kept. The police kept the fake pearls as evidence, so the cabinet was empty. I found out that Tom, Earl, Christopher and my dad all had keys to the cabinet lock. Earl told me the same story Tom did: that they both checked on the necklace before Tom left for the night. Earl admitted that he didn't know if the green necklace he saw was real or fake, since he had never seen green pearls before. He had x-rayed Tom and everything looked normal. He made the same rounds as Tom and ate his breakfast at around 5:30 a.m. He told me that Tom had given him some of his gross meatloaf but that he slipped it to Rufus. He said Rufus really liked it. The next thing he remembered was my dad arriving to get the store ready for business. It was Dad who noticed that the necklace was gone and contacted the police. That was as far as I could get with Earl since Tom was waiting to take me home. I said goodbye to Rufus and went home to bed. The next day I interviewed Christopher. He was the last regular employee to see the necklace. We went on a walk around the building while we talked, and Christopher was careful to avoid the results of Rufus' potty breaks. Christopher explained that he checked on the necklace at the end of the day just before Robert, the armored car driver, came for the store's weekly bank deposit. Tom was there for his night-guard shift, so he helped count the money. The only thing at all out of the ordinary was that one bundle of money was wrapped with string instead of a rubber band. Apparently, Tom found the string in the cash-box and so he used it instead of a rubber band. It was no big deal so he scanned Robert, and the deposit, through the x-ray machine while Tom finished putting the necklace away. He followed Robert out and went home for the day. Now I just had one more person to interview. At lunchtime, I walked over to the restaurant where Robert was eating his lunch. He explained that he arrived at the store like always and met Christopher in the office. He said that the cabinet with the green pearls was open since Christopher was checking on them. Robert also said he looked at them briefly, while Christopher was there, but never picked up the pearls. He, too, noticed the string-wrapped bundle of cash when he was collecting the deposit, but didn't think it was that strange. Some of the stores he collects money from use string occasionally to wrap their money, when they run out of rubber bands. After the jewelry store, he said he just went back to picking up deposits on his route around town. I felt like I was getting nowhere, so I returned to the store to look at the x-ray scans stored in the machine. No one had removed anything they weren't supposed to. The police had the security video from the night of the burglary so I decided to take a look at the one from the day after. I turned it on fast-play and watched customers as they appeared to run in and out of the store. In the video, Tom showed up, cleaned up a little after Rufus, and went back to his car. Then he came back and went inside. Next, Christopher left for the day. Later, Earl and Rufus showed up for work and Tom left. Still later, Rufus came out his door, squatted on the grass a few times, and did other dog stuff. I stopped the video. I realized I had found the answers.

It's a holiday delight, \ntelling of a spooky night. In that night, down darkened streets \ntwo children go beg for treats. \"Halloween? We ignore dangers \nand take candy gifts from strangers!\" Mark and his friend Ann did good, \nvisiting their neighborhood. Candies soon would fill their sacks.\nThey should carry home their snacks. Skies were dark, with moonlit clouds,\nbut they'd left the begging crowds. for one last house, though they didn't know\nit's one spot where they shouldn't go. It's a dark house, there, alone\nWinds make its old windows groan. Grass had fled its dirty lawn.\nAll its trees and plants were gone. Silence took their place, and gloom. \nIt's deserted -- like a tomb. \"This is scary,\" Mark told Ann.\n\"Last time I came here, I ran. \"I heard noises, like a ghost.\"\n\"I'm not scared,\" Ann liked to boast. No one was around that night,\nand Mark's heart was filled with fright. Ann dared him to pay a visit.\n\"Hear those noises? Mark, what is it?\" They tiptoed up to the doorstep.\nMark didn't want to take one more step. Strange noises came from inside.\nbut wind made the door swing wide. Darkness loomed, but Ann could spy \na dirty flashlight waiting nearby. With its beam they saw dark hallways.\nWould Ann take the challenge? Always. She grabbed Mark and whispered slow.\n\"Let's see where these dark halls go.\" With each step the floor would creak\nIts old wood began to reek. Dust and strange smells, all around.\nMark tried not to make a sound. Ann's flashlight then beamed the room\nsearching for those sounds of gloom. In her flashlight, she would trust.\nAll it lit were piles of dust. Giant dust balls, inches wide,\nfilled the house's dark inside. It had gathered over chairs,\nin the corners, on the stairs. Ann was curious, not afraid.\nHow was it those sounds were made? In the dark she paused to stare\nat one footprint on the stair. Grey balls bounced against their shoes.\n\"Let's go up and look for clues.\" \"Or we could go home,\" Mark said.\n\"That noise could be someone dead! Are we safe here?\" Ann said no.\n\"Even so, I've got to know.\" Mark would run, but in that night\nAnn still held the only light. From the downstairs dust that reeks\nto the old staircase that creaks, \u2028Ann would move, then stop to stare\nat the pattern on the stair. On each step, a shape she knew: \nDarker outlines of a shoe In the dust, the stairway mounting,\nUp the steps, Mark started counting. It's a trick he used when scared.\nCounting made him feel prepared. \"One, two, three, four -- I see twelve tracks\nOn the staircase.\" Ann said \"Relax.\" Soon her light had scanned the path.\nShe didn't need to fuss with math. Up the stairs she'd quickly run,\ntelling Mark this would be fun. Leaving him to mull her dares,\nAnn had vanished up the stairs And without the flashlight's spark\nMark stood in the silent dark. Questions seemed to cluster 'round.\nWhat had made that creepy sound? Mark said \"Well, this house is old.\" \nBut besides that -- it was cold. Dust brushed up against his feet.\nMaybe he should eat a treat. Then, like horrors when you're dreaming,\nMark heard Ann's voice. It was screaming. Screaming from upstairs, not stopping.\nWith terror, Mark's sweat was dropping. Should he see if Ann was dead,\nOr just count her screams instead? Three, four, five, six, screams were shrieking\nin that house whose floors were reeking. Eight screams, nine screams, they kept coming.\nTen and more -- the noise was numbing. What was in that room she'd lightened?\nWhat could make Ann's voice so frightened? Panicking now to his core, \nMark couldn't find the entry door. Stumbling through dark surrounding\nThere was just one clue -- that sounding. Ann yelled her eleventh scream\nand just like an awful dream Listening to her screaming voice,\nMark knew he had just one choice, One way not to be alone:\nrun to where Ann's flashlight shone. Without thinking, up he ran\ntowards the fourteen screams of Ann. On that second floor that rotted,\nMark discovered what she'd spotted. What was at the stairway's top?\nWhat he saw would make Mark stop, Stare amazed, and wonder, too.\nGaze was all that he could do. In the silent evening black,\nTwo white eyes were staring back. Hovering with its eyebrows spread,\nthey could see, a floating head!!! Just one head, but in the dark,\nits eyes moved from Ann to Mark. Quite alive, its shining face\nstared at them with ghostly grace. Silently it stared, unfrightened.\nMore dust on the floor was brightened by the glowing face, and by it,\nMark noticed Ann became quiet. He looked at her, and fear grew.\nAnn had witnessed something new. In the dark, but coming near them\ntwo more eyes would come to peer them! Down the hallway, bringing dread\nfloated up a second head! It's a woman, face still ghostly\nwearing ancient makeup, mostly. Bizarre rouge on glowing skin,\nTiny lines on eyebrows thin. Scraggly hair was dangling down,\nfrom her forehead, dirty brown. With its white eyes, Ann felt sure, \nIt was looking back at her. Suddenly the silence broke.\nThat white floating head? It spoke. \"Who?\" it asked Ann. \"Who are you?\nCan you hear me? You are new!\" \"Yes,\" the other face replied.\n\"What has made you stray inside?\" In the dark and silent house,\nAnn was quiet as a mouse. \"Speak!\" the face said, angry now.\n\"What has brought us here -- and how?\" Mark knew in that haunted night,\nsilence would be impolite. So he told the ghosts, \"It's late.\nHalloween, 2008. In this house, we found your head\nfloating here. We think you're dead. Maybe there's one day between\nlife and death, on Halloween. When you feel that night begin,\nGhosts can roam the earth again.\" Ann now asked them for a clue.\n\"We're just children. Who are you?\" And the glowing man's face moaned.\nOf an ancient pain he groaned. \"I was once a famous chief\nof an Indian tribe. A thief stole into our camp one night\nand he killed me in a fight.\" Soon his eyelids closed with fears.\nWhite and bloodshot eyes shed tears Then the female head moaned low,\n\"That's a century ago! I was wealthy, filled with kicks\nback in 1846. Till a sickness in the night\nturned my head into this fright.\" When they pondered how they'd died,\nboth the floating heads soon cried.\u2028 Through his sobs, the Indian chief\nshared the reason for his grief. \"We shared meadows without guilt\nbefore houses here were built.\" And the wealthy woman thought\nof the joys her life had brought. \"I strolled gaily down the street.\nYou know what I miss? My feet!\" Both heads then looked towards the ground,\nBut no feet there could be found. \"I once wore the poshest clothes,\nled to dances by my beaus. We became such dainty trippers, \nnight and day wore high-heeled slippers.\u201d But now she sighed.\n\"Guess it's true -- I finally died.\" Then the chief remembered fun\nwhen he'd used his legs to run. \"All my life, the sweetest treat?\nFeeling grass on my feet. Always barefoot, always running,\nTracking game with all my cunning.\" Then the chief was startled loudly \nby a voice that rang out proudly. Mark and Ann stared for the flicker,\nTwo more ghost heads soon would bicker. \"This is wrong,\" the new head cried.\n\"Tell us when it was we died. \"1890? '92?\n\"I'm a ghost. Should I say 'boo?'\" They arrived, two more undead,\ndressed like they were newly wed. For the female head was pale.\non her face she wore a veil. On the man's head, hair was shiny \nslicked in place. His eyes were tiny. His bride also missed a treat\nwhere she'd dressed in fabrics sweet. As a child, and as wife --\nballet slippers, all her life. Now she stared, sad and defeated.\n\"This is wrong,\" her ghost repeated. With an angry voice her groom\nfollowed from a darkened room. \"We don't know you,\" he announced.\nTowards the other heads he bounced, As the hallway all around\nfilled with angry clomping sounds. Now the four heads -- two still sobbing\nIn the hallway floated, bobbing. Mark and Ann stared helplessly\ntil the bride shared her sad plea. \"There's one issue -- we agree here.\nWhat has summoned us to be here?\" All the other heads soon nodded.\nFrom their rests they'd now been prodded. And the wealthy woman railed\nat the way her fate had failed. \"Let us rest in peace,\" she'd say.\n\"Even on this holiday.\" \"We belong in our own world,\" \nshe complained. Her eyebrow curled. \"It must be some earthly pest\ndisturbing our well-earned rest!\" \"Find the crook,\" the Indian moaned.\n\"Who defiles us?\" Ann now groaned. All the heads that had just spoken\nNow glared straight at her, awoken from their peaceful ghostly slumbers.\nMark, in fright, returned to numbers. After all this elocution,\nWould the ghosts seek retribution? Was it dark revenge that waited?\nOr could ghosts still be placated? Suddenly, a hope Mark knew.\nHe remembered one small clue. \"Yes, you were aroused tonight.\nBut it wasn't Ann's small light. Someone's played a trick on you,\ndoused their face with ghostly goo Glowing white, but not a spirit.\nThey just wanted to get near it, So to watch when you awoke,\nspying on you ghostly folk.

And I was always worried about an acrobat named Lorenzo. He was my father, and he'd exercised every day until his slender body was covered with muscles. He was stuck in the bottom row of the pyramid, the acrobat supporting the other gymnasts who stood on his shoulders. More acrobats stood on their shoulders, and more on theirs \u2026 and then a clown knocked them all down. Our circus high-wire star earned twice as much money as the acrobats. After two years of hard practice, my father still hadn't earned a spot on the high-wire team. He was stuck on the ground with the tumblers, performing each night in their routines without a break for three solid hours. Tonight I saw disappointment in his face as the spotlight focused high above him on a wire strung from the circus tent poles. And that's when the crime happened. That same night our circus had received an angry visit from the town's sheriff. \"Your freaks don't belong here,\" he'd said fiercely. Lorenzo had watched with shame and anger as the sheriff bellowed, \"Circus people steal. And you're creepy looking, too. Get out of our village now!\" \"We received this permit months ago,\" said our ringmaster with laughter and warmth. \"And an honorable man like yourself wouldn't want to disappoint your 3,000 neighbors sharing a friendly evening with our circus family.\" The sheriff demanded a look at the permit and a chance to inspect the facilities, insisting that each customer in this dangerous place meant more work for his department on a Sunday night. The ringmaster continued flattering the sheriff, knowing we couldn't afford to cancel the Sunday show. It was an almost magical tradition \u2013 each weekend no matter how much money the circus earned, exactly one-third of that amount came from the Sunday crowds. But now the tight-wire had broken, and one of our performers was falling towards the ground! It was a 100-foot drop, and the audience gasped, but Lorenzo and I felt even more frightened. The falling man was the \u201cGreat Marchelli\" -- the proudest member of our circus family. We watched as Marchelli leaned his falling body forward. Suddenly he grabbed his knees and somehow hurled his legs over his head, doing an erratic somersault in the air. As he tried to propel his body into the safety net, he fell and missed! But Marchelli, being great, quickly stretched his arm out, grabbing desperately for the net's edge as he fell. The net stretched tight, stopping Marchelli's fall, and as the net sprung back into position, Marchelli used its momentum to hurl himself up into another confident somersault. He landed gracefully in the net on one knee, his arms stretched proudly. Marchelli glowed with pride and even arrogance. He spent his childhood in the circus, never learning to read or write, so he took an extra pride in his great performing skills. It was the ringmaster who was most concerned. With the sheriff arguing that circus people were crooks, he'd wanted to look organized and in control. And because the ringmaster was afraid of heights himself, he was most proud of the circus high-wire act. He shouted praise to the audience about the Great Marchelli. He added that circus life was full of excitement and surprises, and its trained experts were ready for anything. Though, his excitement would disappear when he found out he had been robbed. When the crowds left for the night, Zelda, the fortune teller, removed her wig of wild dark hair, and put on a pair of glasses. Privately she was proud of her ability with math, and she wanted everyone to know they could rely on her numbers. \"Lorenzo needs to buy gifts for his family!\" said the ringmaster with a smile, walking with my father into her trailer. But during the circus's performance, the money had been stolen. \"And there's something even stranger,\" Zelda said honestly. \"They didn't steal all of it!\" The money was locked in metal boxes, and every day in her book Zelda recorded the amount in each box before handing them over to the ringmaster on Sunday nights. After she'd reviewed the figures in her mysterious black book, she'd reached her startling conclusion. \"They stole some of our money?\" the ringmaster asked, genuinely puzzled. \"But why?\" \"The thief left us a note,\" Zelda replied, pulling a folder piece of paper from one metal box, sitting empty on her desk. It read: I took what you owed me. Tonight the wire will snap. \"That's our money!\" shouted Lorenzo angrily, as the ringmaster eyed him with suspicion, \nrecalling Lorenzo's eagerness to join the high-wire act. \"It wasn't me,\" Lorenzo protested as we left. \"Maybe the Great Marchelli sabotaged his own act, determined to steal the spotlight one more time!\" I wondered if Marchelli had a plan that was even more wicked. Maybe he'd faked that spectacular fall, just to cast suspicion on my father. That would ensure that my father would never be promoted into his place. Zelda wailed that she'd guarded the money carefully. \"The money could only have been stolen after the circus started -- and even then I was only gone for minutes to get our permit for the sheriff.\" Did the sheriff ask you himself? \"No,\" she said hesitantly. \"The ringmaster sent me to retrieve it from his desk in the front wagon.\" Her eyes focused, deep in thought, as she tried to imagine what happened in that time. Had his worries over profitability forced him to \"steal\" some money to hide it from his employees? We opened her book of numbers: Friday: $3927 \nSaturday: $8073 \"I didn't even get to finish calculating the numbers for Sunday! Zelda wailed. Was there anyone who was owed money? \"No!\" Zelda exclaimed. \"Everyone is paid equally, and always at the end of the week!\" she sighed. \"The ringmaster insists that each one of us be treated the same \u2013 except Marchelli, who gets a double share. There are 99 of us, and Marchelli's extra share makes it an even 100.\" On Friday and Saturday there were two boxes: One for the ticket sales before 3:00 p.m., and then one for the remainder of the day. But on Sundays, Zelda kept all of the day's money in a single box. One of the boxes was missing, and there were four boxes remaining with the following amount of money: $1817 \n$4012 \n$2110 \n$4061 \"Call the sheriff,\" I said. \"I know who stole your money. And I also know who is responsible for cutting Marchelli\u2019s rope!\u201d Who stole the money?\nAnswer:","targets":["\"The numbers for Friday and Saturday add up to $12,000, we can calculate that the\nSunday box should've held $6,000 -- one-third of the weekend total. That must be the box that's missing.\"\n\n\"The thief's note warned that: \"I only took what you owed me.\" But none of our performers were owed $6,000. Using Zelda's figures, each person's share this week would be just one hundredth of $18,000 -- or $180 apiece. To be owed $6,000, they'd have to have gone unpaid for something close to 30 weeks.

A young man of 15 named Michael Rembrant was being driven in a car by his mother to a crime scene. The youth was well known for solving all sorts of mysteries, and so he was the first to be asked in a case about a murder. Michael didn't have anything better to do, and so his mom drove him there, for she didn't want him to be caught in the rain. \"Just text me when you're done and I will pick you up.\" his mother said sweetly. Michael smiled and said, \"Thanks Mom. I love you.\" After a brief, motherly kiss on the cheek, the young detective walked inside the building that hosts the crime scene; the old town hall. Michael briskly walked up the steps under his black umbrella, being assaulted by the rain and wind. He exhaled a breath of relief as he entered the warm and dry hall. The hall was a large, open room, with a stage and a cafeteria on opposite sides. On either side of the stage was a hallway that lead back to the restrooms, most likely for actors. The young detective brushed his damp, black hair out of his face, his eyes darting around observing the hall. The police chief welcomed the prodigy and quickly escorted him to a secluded room behind the stage where 3 people were already sitting. There was a man who was very well-dressed in a grey suit, a yellow tie, and his hair (or lack thereof), neatly combed to the side. He was the type of man you would expect to find in an office, typing away on a keyboard, or demonstrating figures in a meeting. He introduced himself as Mario Marcino. Beside him was a very attractive woman who looked to be no older than 25. She had a pink, velvet scarf around her neck, long blonde hair curled ever-so-slightly into a neat wave that pronounced her features. She wore a tight, white dress that exposed black stockings on her thin legs. Michael recognized her as a rising actress from Carberry known as Marie Carloette, here to star in a show being performed at the hall. He looked to see beside the woman to see another man advanced in years. His face was littered with wrinkles with a round nose making itself known at the center of his face, drawing away from the small eyes that narrowed when he saw the young prodigy. He was dressed in a black suit, similar to that of a butler. His vision shifted from scowling at Michael to the police chief saying, \"I am not sure you are making the best decision, requesting the assistance of a child.\" The sleuth recognized him as the bartender at the local pub, Bruce Whittingley. Michael paid little attention to this comment, and quickly asked the police chief, \"So why did you ask me to come here?\" The police chief replied saying that \"There has been a murder of one of the actors, and these three were the only ones here with the victim. The victim's name was Robert Nesnick, a 35-year old who was rehearsing until he was struck in the back of the head by a metal coffee pitcher. His body was discovered at 7:30 in the men's room. We still do not know who did this.\" Michael nodded at this information and asked each suspect what they were doing before the body was found. Mario began saying that he visited his wife's office before arriving at the town hall. He arrived at the town hall at about 7:00, when he realized that he forgot his script at his wife's office, called her at 7:05, and waited outside for her until about 7:20 outside while smoking a cigarette. Michael wrote down the details and continued on to ask Marie. She explained that she arrived early at around 6:50, but she had to wait outside until 6:55 because Mario and Robert were the only ones with a key. She had coffee with Robert, Bruce and Mario at around 7:05, went to the washroom to refresh her make-up a little while later, and came out at around 7:25. Michael wrote down her details as well, and moved on to Bruce. Bruce grunted begrudgingly and began to explain. Bruce arrived at around 6:57 and saw that Mario, Robert and Marie were having coffee. Bruce went and made the coffee and they all drank together. At around 7:08, he saw Marie leave for the washroom. Robert left shortly afterward to look for and check on some props behind the stage. At 7:15, Bruce joined Mario in smoking a cigarette until 7:20 when they both went back inside. Bruce went to the washroom at 7:30, and discovered Robert, slumped over in one of the stalls, his head in the toilet. After hearing all of the testimonies, Michael looked at his notepad and then closed it. The chief then said, \"I understand if you need some time to figure this out.\" Michael smiled and said, \"That won't be necessary. I already know who it is.\" The young prodigy then confidently pointed at the murderer and said, \"Arrest this person for first degree murder!\" Who is the murderer?\nAnswer:","targets":["Marie Carloette had a look of surprise, saying, \"Why would you say that? I had no idea who murdered him!\"\n\nMichael smiled saying, \"I know that you killed him because you were the only one left. Mario talked to his wife, and so she could be called as a witness. Your time leaving for the restroom would give you enough time to kill Robert with the pitcher and drag him to the men's room while Bruce and Mario were having a smoke, for which they could witness each other. My only question is why?\"\n\nMarie suddenly broke her stunned persona and replied, \"Because I couldn't stand Robert controlling this show. Acting means the world to me, and yet that rookie knew nothing of this art! I wanted to teach him a lesson, and make it so I could rule this show!\" The murderous actress laughs maniacally as she is hand-cuffed by the police chief.\n\nMichael then sadly said, \"It looks like this star has fallen from the spotlight, and flickered out.\" as she was taken away by the police chief."],"multiple_choice_targets":[],"multiple_choice_scores":[],"idx":76,"is_generated":false,"true_idx":76},{"inputs":"Story: The Straw Hat Theater, nestled in Vermont\u2019s idyllic Northeast Kingdom, was enjoying a banner season. The summer offerings, a shrewd mix of new plays and old standards, with some familiar operettas by Offenbach or Rodgers and Hammerstein thrown in for balance, routinely drew sellout crowds at each performance. Rumors that the last play to be offered, a dark comedy called, \u201cAll\u2019s Right Now That You\u2019re Here\u201d, would feature a film star, increased the sense of excitement whenever summer theater fans talked about the summer\u2019s offerings. However, Resident Director Arthur Glendon refused to comment on those rumors, rightly calculating that his non-denials would fan the rumors and continue to swell box office receipts. The current show, \u201cLehar\u2019s Merry Widow\u201d, was a perennial favorite. It made no difference that half the audience knew all of the song lyrics by heart. They could - and often did - sing along with the cast as the numbers were performed. So why was it, Arthur Glendon said to himself as he opened the day\u2019s mail, that the theater\u2019s bills had not been paid in full? Here, for example, was a horrendous bill from Vermont Electric and Power. It had been a warm summer, but this was northern Vermont, after all, not Jamaica! Surely the air conditioners were not on 24 hours a day! And the catering bill, which supplied snacks for the cast and food for the lodge kitchen, was too high. All told, carry-over balances from the previous month\u2019s bills were $400. Glendon called both companies and was assured that the bills rendered were correct. The previous month\u2019s bills had only been partially paid. Fortunately, the other bills, which also trickled in early in the month, all seemed to be in order. Then he called Basil Carmody, accountant to the Straw Hat Theater Company for years. Basil drove over to the summer theater with the account books in his briefcase. \u201cAs you know, Arthur, I pick up the cash and checks from your cashier, Martha Gilmont, every Sunday evening after the performance. I\u2019m a season ticket holder myself and see that show every week. We count the receipts together - I sign a receipt which she countersigns, and then I deposit the money in the Vermont Enterprise Bank on Monday morning. It\u2019s the same system that we\u2019ve had for years. I\u2019ve never known her to make a mistake.\u201d \u201cWho do you deal with at the bank?\u201d Basil replied, \u201cUsually Lawrence Blake, the Head Teller. He\u2019s been with them for years.\u201d Glendon kept pressing Basil, \u201cWho pays the bills?\u201d \u201cWhy, John Franklin, of course, your Treasurer.\u201d \u201cHow does he know what the bank balances are?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s easy. The Vermont Enterprise Bank is online. All John does is to log in to the account, and the information is there. He of course also has the company checkbook, which I do not. As a matter of fact, I think he - and you - are the only ones authorized to write checks for the Straw Hat Theater Company. Satisfied?\u201d \u201cOf course, Basil. Nothing implied. It\u2019s just that we seem to be short, and I don\u2019t know why. I wanted to know exactly what our procedures are, that\u2019s all. Arthur Glendon frowned. He was not a trained investigator and didn\u2019t want to act like one. Talking with an old, trusted friend like Basil Carmody was one thing. He couldn\u2019t imagine calling in the local sheriff. That would really upset the entire theater staff and perhaps ruin the season. Some of the more imaginative actors might enjoy the experience, but it would not help sell tickets. Come to think of it, selling tickets wasn\u2019t the problem! Glendon decided on a forthright approach. As soon as Martha Gilmont came into the office from her coffee break, he asked her about office procedures. \u201cWe\u2019re just not doing as well as we should be doing, Martha. I\u2019m trying to find out why.\u201d She explained what he already knew, including the discounts that were offered for season tickets and the First Thursday special prices, available only with a coupon cut out from the local newspaper. She had a precise record of receipts, performance by performance. To save money the box office didn\u2019t accept credit cards, which caused some grumbling. The proceeds were about two-thirds in cash and the rest in local checks. She even kept the coupons that were presented at the box office for ticket discounts on First Thursdays, $8 off each ticket. Each performance record was in a separate manila envelope and was countersigned by Basil Carmody. Each week, he left with her the bank receipt for the previous Monday\u2019s deposit of cash and checks. Trying to figure out what was happening, Glendon asked Martha, \u201cHow long do you spend at the box office?\u201d Her answer surprised him. \u201cUntil halfway through the first act. Nobody comes for tickets after that. I like to see the shows too!\u201d \u201cDo you make up the performance records before you leave the box office?\u201d She turned red. \u201cNo. Everything is in the drawer, and I lock the outside door - after the performance I grab a cup of coffee and do the receipts. It\u2019s tedious, but I\u2019m careful. My eyes aren\u2019t what they used to be, so I double and triple check everything!\u201d John Franklin, the Treasurer, was surprised at the inquiry. He was by profession an actor. The few duties involved in handling the theater company checkbook were paid for by a nice stipend. He was glad to have the work, if work was the right word for writing a few checks every week. \u201cYes, Arthur, that\u2019s the drill. After you see the bills, they come to me, and I write checks for payment. Of course, first I log on to the checking account at the Vermont Enterprise Bank on the office computer. And of course, I have to make sure that the checks we get have cleared before I write our own checks. That sometimes takes a couple of days. I\u2019ll also get the monthly bank statements. The next one for this summer should be arriving in a couple of weeks.\u201d Glendon pressed for details, \u201cBut you didn\u2019t pay either the power company or the caterer last month in full?\u201d John defended his actions, telling Glendon, \u201cThat\u2019s right. There wasn\u2019t enough money. I probably should have raised it with you, Arthur, but I thought it best to pay off all the bills I could. I thought that I could catch up this month. Is there a problem?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not sure. I hope not. I guess I\u2019m just surprised that we aren\u2019t doing better, given the full houses we\u2019ve been attracting.\u201d Lawrence Blake was a taciturn Vermonter, given to monosyllables and long silences. \u201cNope, I don\u2019t handle the account any different from any other - Basil Carmody deposits the receipts on Monday mornings, and I give him a receipt. The checks come in later, of course, signed by your Treasurer. The current one is John Franklin. I saw him last year, but haven\u2019t seen him this summer. I gather he\u2019s got a role in \u201cThe Merry Widow\u201d. That would be worth seeing.\u201d Returning to the Box Office, which was an alcove with a window off the main theater office, Arthur Glendon checked the box office receipts once again. Something didn\u2019t seem quite right. Then it came to him. As he thought, the discount coupons were xerox copies, not originals. He returned to his part of the office and sat at his desk. \u201cThis is just a one pipe problem,\u201d he said to himself. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be a great problem for Sherlock Holmes, and it certainly isn\u2019t for me.\u201d The trick, without solid proof, was to get reimbursement for the missing $400, and also stop the thefts from ever happening again. He was quite sure that with a low-key talk, both goals would quickly be accomplished.

They had first become friends long ago when they all lived at the Keswick Apartment complex together as young couples. Over the years, they had all advanced in their careers and long since moved out of the apartment complex. Yet, they had all remained friends. In addition to the occasional party in which they all got together, they always rented a great big house on the Outer Banks of North Carolina for four days over New Year\u2019s. One of the things that made it easier for all of them to remain friends was that each couple had children that were all about the same age. Each couple had a teenager between 14 and 16. They all also had children in the 8 to 10 year old range, a total of eight children in this age range among the five families. All of the children had been friends since the day they were born, all of the older kids having been born while their parents lived at the apartment complex. While the younger children were evenly split into four boys and four girls, the same was not the case with the older children. For the older children, there were four boys and just a single girl: Aly. For most of the time growing up, Aly was a tomboy who fit in perfectly with the other boys, but this New Year\u2019s was different. While she was still an athlete who enjoyed sports, Aly was turning into an attractive young woman. That fact was most certainly not lost on the four boys. Aly\u2019s dad Tom certainly made note of the attention that his daughter was now receiving from the boys. He was going to do his best to keep an eye on his oldest daughter. As was tradition when the families went to the Outer Banks, the families split into two groups. The adults took over the giant great room on the top floor next to the kitchen. There they would play cards, talk and watch TV while everyone took turns in the kitchen. Meanwhile, the children went to the playroom on the bottom floor. This room had a pool table, a ping-pong table, plenty of couches and a big screen TV. It was not problem keeping the kids occupied. Long ago, the kids had set up a rule of winner stays on the table for the ping-pong and pool tables. All of the little kids hoped that someday they would be able to unseat the long time champs. Danny owned the ping-pong table. As always, he got on the table and won every game he played. His plan was to see if he could play from right after dinner until sunrise without losing a game. Meanwhile, Reese owned the pool table. He fancied himself as a pool shark and he certainly seemed to play like one. Having heard Danny\u2019s challenge, his goal was to do exactly the same thing on the pool table. All of the other children took turns challenging first one and then the other. Everyone knew that if anyone ever beat Danny or Reese, there would most certainly be a loud celebration. For the most part, Tom was prepared to enjoy New Year\u2019s Eve. When everyone first arrived, he had scoured the house to ensure that there was no lingering mistletoe that might prompt one of the young boys to steal a kiss from Aly. However, he was really worried that at the stroke of midnight, one of them would be tempted to steak a kiss. He knew however that as long as Aly was downstairs with everyone, she would not kiss anyone in front of all the other children. Thus, he put his mind to rest and enjoyed his New Year\u2019s celebration. As she always did just before midnight, Diane took a big plate of her world famous chocolate chip cookies down to the kids. The rule was that as soon as it hit midnight, they were free to pounce on them, but not a moment before. They never lasted for more than a minute or two before the kids had finished them off. As the clock struck midnight, Tom went out onto the top deck with all of the other parents to watch the fireworks that always went off a few minutes after midnight. That was when he saw his daughter climb over the sand dune and head back into the house. Although Tom did not see any of the boys with Aly, he was pretty certain that Aly had been on the other side of the sand dune at midnight with one of the boys. While he was confident that Aly would tell him the truth about kissing one of the boys if she did it, he also knew that she would never tell him who it was. Thus, he was going to have to figure it out for himself if he was going to ever know. Telling his wife Diane that he would be back in a few minutes, Tom went downstairs to talk with Aly and the other kids. The first thing that he did when he got downstairs was to ask the kids if anything special had happened tonight. Other than it being just after midnight on New Year\u2019s Eve, there was nothing unusual that happened. He then asked Aly if he could talk to her in private. She giggled and said yes. When he asked her what she was doing out behind the sand dune at midnight, she told him that she had been with one of the boys. She also told him that indeed, she had kissed him. The pounding in his head told Tom that it was going to be a very long year, even if Aly was a really great kid. His next question was who was the boy. As expected, Aly refused to give him the name. It looked like he was going to have to do some investigative work. Jeremy, his face covered in chocolate, came up to Tom and told him that as always, his wife had made the greatest cookies. Tom was too busy to pay attention as he was trying to figure out who it was that had kissed his daughter. Unfortunately, he had no clue whatsoever, so reluctantly Tom headed upstairs to face Diane. After telling everything to Diane, he asked her if she would please try to get Aly to tell her who had kissed her. Diane said that she did not need to ask, as she already knew. Who kissed Aly?\nAnswer:","targets":["\u201cWhat do you mean you already know?\u201d Tom asked. \u201cAre you going to give me that comment about a mother always knows?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo need to do that this time\u201d Diane replied. \u201cThe answer is obvious if you would open your mind a little bit.\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst of all, there are four possible suspects. Danny and Reese have been living on the pool table and the ping-pong table. If either of them had lost a game, the little kids would most certainly have made a note about that. Because no one mentioned either of them losing a game, they obviously were playing at midnight and thus could not have gone off with Aly. Meanwhile, Jeremy had chocolate on his face. Therefore, he obviously was in the room at midnight to get some cookies. That leaves RJ as the only other possibility.\u201d"],"multiple_choice_targets":[],"multiple_choice_scores":[],"idx":116,"is_generated":false,"true_idx":116},{"inputs":"Story: There was a crime, and I was worried. And I was always worried about an acrobat named Lorenzo. He was my father, and he'd exercised every day until his slender body was covered with muscles. He was stuck in the bottom row of the pyramid, the acrobat supporting the other gymnasts who stood on his shoulders. More acrobats stood on their shoulders, and more on theirs \u2026 and then a clown knocked them all down. Our circus high-wire star earned twice as much money as the acrobats. After two years of hard practice, my father still hadn't earned a spot on the high-wire team. He was stuck on the ground with the tumblers, performing each night in their routines without a break for three solid hours. Tonight I saw disappointment in his face as the spotlight focused high above him on a wire strung from the circus tent poles. And that's when the crime happened. That same night our circus had received an angry visit from the town's sheriff. \"Your freaks don't belong here,\" he'd said fiercely. Lorenzo had watched with shame and anger as the sheriff bellowed, \"Circus people steal. And you're creepy looking, too. Get out of our village now!\" \"We received this permit months ago,\" said our ringmaster with laughter and warmth. \"And an honorable man like yourself wouldn't want to disappoint your 3,000 neighbors sharing a friendly evening with our circus family.\" The sheriff demanded a look at the permit and a chance to inspect the facilities, insisting that each customer in this dangerous place meant more work for his department on a Sunday night. The ringmaster continued flattering the sheriff, knowing we couldn't afford to cancel the Sunday show. It was an almost magical tradition \u2013 each weekend no matter how much money the circus earned, exactly one-third of that amount came from the Sunday crowds. But now the tight-wire had broken, and one of our performers was falling towards the ground! It was a 100-foot drop, and the audience gasped, but Lorenzo and I felt even more frightened. The falling man was the \u201cGreat Marchelli\" -- the proudest member of our circus family. We watched as Marchelli leaned his falling body forward. Suddenly he grabbed his knees and somehow hurled his legs over his head, doing an erratic somersault in the air. As he tried to propel his body into the safety net, he fell and missed! But Marchelli, being great, quickly stretched his arm out, grabbing desperately for the net's edge as he fell. The net stretched tight, stopping Marchelli's fall, and as the net sprung back into position, Marchelli used its momentum to hurl himself up into another confident somersault. He landed gracefully in the net on one knee, his arms stretched proudly. Marchelli glowed with pride and even arrogance. He spent his childhood in the circus, never learning to read or write, so he took an extra pride in his great performing skills. It was the ringmaster who was most concerned. With the sheriff arguing that circus people were crooks, he'd wanted to look organized and in control. And because the ringmaster was afraid of heights himself, he was most proud of the circus high-wire act. He shouted praise to the audience about the Great Marchelli. He added that circus life was full of excitement and surprises, and its trained experts were ready for anything. Though, his excitement would disappear when he found out he had been robbed. When the crowds left for the night, Zelda, the fortune teller, removed her wig of wild dark hair, and put on a pair of glasses. Privately she was proud of her ability with math, and she wanted everyone to know they could rely on her numbers. \"Lorenzo needs to buy gifts for his family!\" said the ringmaster with a smile, walking with my father into her trailer. But during the circus's performance, the money had been stolen. \"And there's something even stranger,\" Zelda said honestly. \"They didn't steal all of it!\" The money was locked in metal boxes, and every day in her book Zelda recorded the amount in each box before handing them over to the ringmaster on Sunday nights. After she'd reviewed the figures in her mysterious black book, she'd reached her startling conclusion. \"They stole some of our money?\" the ringmaster asked, genuinely puzzled. \"But why?\" \"The thief left us a note,\" Zelda replied, pulling a folder piece of paper from one metal box, sitting empty on her desk. It read: I took what you owed me. Tonight the wire will snap. \"That's our money!\" shouted Lorenzo angrily, as the ringmaster eyed him with suspicion, \nrecalling Lorenzo's eagerness to join the high-wire act. \"It wasn't me,\" Lorenzo protested as we left. \"Maybe the Great Marchelli sabotaged his own act, determined to steal the spotlight one more time!\" I wondered if Marchelli had a plan that was even more wicked. Maybe he'd faked that spectacular fall, just to cast suspicion on my father. That would ensure that my father would never be promoted into his place. Zelda wailed that she'd guarded the money carefully. \"The money could only have been stolen after the circus started -- and even then I was only gone for minutes to get our permit for the sheriff.\" Did the sheriff ask you himself? \"No,\" she said hesitantly. \"The ringmaster sent me to retrieve it from his desk in the front wagon.\" Her eyes focused, deep in thought, as she tried to imagine what happened in that time. Had his worries over profitability forced him to \"steal\" some money to hide it from his employees? We opened her book of numbers: Friday: $3927 \nSaturday: $8073 \"I didn't even get to finish calculating the numbers for Sunday! Zelda wailed. Was there anyone who was owed money? \"No!\" Zelda exclaimed. \"Everyone is paid equally, and always at the end of the week!\" she sighed. \"The ringmaster insists that each one of us be treated the same \u2013 except Marchelli, who gets a double share. There are 99 of us, and Marchelli's extra share makes it an even 100.\" On Friday and Saturday there were two boxes: One for the ticket sales before 3:00 p.m., and then one for the remainder of the day. But on Sundays, Zelda kept all of the day's money in a single box. One of the boxes was missing, and there were four boxes remaining with the following amount of money: $1817 \n$4012 \n$2110 \n$4061 \"Call the sheriff,\" I said. \"I know who stole your money. And I also know who is responsible for cutting Marchelli\u2019s rope!\u201d Who stole the money?\nAnswer:","targets":["\"The numbers for Friday and Saturday add up to $12,000, we can calculate that the\nSunday box should've held $6,000 -- one-third of the weekend total. That must be the box that's missing.\"\n\n\"The thief's note warned that: \"I only took what you owed me.\" But none of our performers were owed $6,000. Using Zelda's figures, each person's share this week would be just one hundredth of $18,000 -- or $180 apiece. To be owed $6,000, they'd have to have gone unpaid for something close to 30 weeks. And I'm sure the ringmaster would've heard about that by now!\"\n\n\"What if it was the ringmaster himself who stole the money and cut the cable?\" asked the sheriff.\n\n\"He couldn't have,\" I pointed out. \"The ringmaster is afraid of heights, and couldn't possibly have climbed that pole to cut the cable.\"\n\n\"I think Lorenzo stole the money!\" shouted the great Marchelli. \"He's been after my extra salary for two years.\"\n\n\"He works hard, that's for sure,\" I continued. \"In fact, tonight's acrobatic performance for more than three hours wouldn't leave any time to steal the money. Zelda said it was stolen during the performance!\"\n\n\"Maybe Marchelli stole the money,\" Lorenzo shot back.\n\n\"I doubt the Great Marchelli left us a note,\" I pointed out, \"since the great Marchelli can't even read or write.\"\n\nEveryone looked around sullenly. \"I can't imagine it's one of us,\" I continued.\n\n\"But who's the man who insisted that each customer Sunday made more work for him?\"\n\nThe sheriff looked up, his face red with embarrassment.

Very sparing of words, was Mr. Crowley. \u2018\u201cAbout seven o\u2019clock the telephone rang and he asked me to answer it. It was my wife asking me to return at once to see an unexpected visitor. Finishing the conversation, I returned to my chair and, after I explained the call, Crowley nodded assent to my request to leave immediately. \u2018\u201cOn the way out, as the lights had not been turned on, I bumped my head, which explains this bruise. Just as I reached the door, he called after me\u2014\u2018See you tomorrow at ten.\u2019 He was certainly all right when I left him shortly after seven.\u201d \u2018Although Bronson\u2019s telephone alibi was later proved sound, he had hardly finished his story before I was convinced he was implicated,\u2019 concluded Fordney.

Contrary to popular belief, she was never bored and always busy! Not only did she have her own two precious angels to look after, 3-year-old Angelica and 6-year-old Caedon, but she also took care of two neighbourhood brothers, Ross & Tony Price, aged 5 and 7. Having four young children in the house always came with lots of surprises! On this beautiful summer day, Leslie had baking on the brain. After shooing the kids out into the backyard to play, she got to work. An hour and a half later, she was pleased with her final results: an apple pie, a batch of ginger snap cookies and a dozen double-chocolate cupcakes. The kids seemed to be enjoying their time out in the sunshine, as Leslie watched them through the window the kitchen door. She bundled up the pie and the cookies, and was just about to put away the cupcakes when she heard loud crying from the backyard. Leaving the cupcakes on the kitchen counter, she rushed out the kitchen door, she saw that little Ross had gotten stung by a bee, right on the bottom of his foot. Scooping him up, she brought the other kids in through the kitchen, directing them to the go to the playroom. Taking Ross to the upstairs bathroom, she tended to his foot and tried to get him settled down. Tony, Ross\u2019s big brother came up with them, but eventually, Leslie told him to join the other kids downstairs. Poor Tony just wanted to help, but his worried questions and nervousness wasn\u2019t helping Ross calm down. In time, Ross\u2019 tears dried, but he still wouldn\u2019t put pressure on his foot. Leslie carried him downstairs and sat him down on the big comfy chair in the playroom. Tony immediately rushed to his side, asking how he felt and trying to give him hugs and kisses in an attempt to make him feel better. Leslie decided she should go upstairs and call Mrs. Price to let her know what had happened. After a short phone call, Leslie checked on the kids in the playroom then went back to the kitchen to finish up. As she went to put the cupcakes away, she realized one was missing\u201411 instead of 12! She smiled as she shook her head. She knew that leaving her freshly baked cupcakes out in the open was a temptation and that each of the kids enjoyed her double-chocolate cupcakes. However, all the kids knew the rules \u2013 they were not allowed to take any food without getting permission. Now, she had to figure out who the culprit was and take appropriate action! She quickly surveyed the kitchen. Nothing looked to be out of the ordinary except for one of her large, oak kitchen chairs. Leslie had pushed all the chairs in after they were done lunch, but this one looked like it had been pulled back out again, out then hastily (but not properly) pushed back in. Heading back to the playroom, she sat down on the couch beside Ross and observed the kids. Ross had gotten a hold of a teddy bear and looked like he was starting to fall asleep, oblivious to the story that Tony was trying to read to him. Caedon was noisily playing with superhero figurines. Angelica was busy preparing a pretend meal on the stove top of her toy kitchen set. There was no obvious signs that one of the kids had eaten the cupcakes \u2013 no chocolate fingers or dirty mouths. Leslie had to assume that the cupcake had been hidden, as none of these kids were particularly neat eaters at this stage in their lives (she ought to know!) Angelica was generally a happy child. She was a mama\u2019s girl and loved helping Leslie in the kitchen and with chores. Right now, Leslie was working on teaching her the value of patience which was proving to be a challenge! Ross was a small, quiet boy, but got along well with others. He absolutely loved sweets, but was a picker eater otherwise. Tony played the ever-protective big brother role, often times questioning the decisions Leslie made. However, Mrs. Price had talked to Leslie about the struggles they were having in teaching him to not take things that didn\u2019t belong to him. Caedon was the leader of the little group. He was good-natured, but he was often bossy with his peers, tending to want things his own way. Leslie was constantly reminding him to put others first; having Ross & Tony around certainly gave him the opportunity to practice! After a few moments spent deep in thought, she had the solution. \u201cEveryone, come here and sit by me. We have something very important to talk about.\u201d Leslie patted the couch beside her. After the children had gathered, she began by saying, \u201cYou all know that I have been baking this afternoon. I made some double chocolate cupcakes. But now, one is missing. Someone took it when I wasn\u2019t looking. We all know that is against the rules. Does anyone know what happened?\u201d Four sets of wide eyes looked back at her as they all shook their heads from side to side. So, there was one little actor in their midst! \u201cWell, I know who did it.\u201d She turned toward the culprit and said, \u201cBut what I want to know is where you have hidden the cupcake!\u201d Who stole the cupcake?\nAnswer:","targets":["Caedon\u2019s wide-eyed looked turned into a scowl. \u201cHow do you know it was me, it coulda been anyone, Mom! Not fair!\u201d\n\n\u201cCaedon, here is how I know it was you. First, your little sister is much too small to reach the kitchen counter and she isn\u2019t strong enough to move the kitchen chairs. She couldn\u2019t have taken the cupcake because she couldn\u2019t reach it. Ross was with me most of the time. Even when I went upstairs to make the phone call, he still didn\u2019t want walk on his sore foot, so he wouldn\u2019t have walked all the way in to the kitchen. Tony was worried sick about Ross and sat down at his side as soon as I brought Ross back to the playroom. He was in the same spot when I returned from my phone call. I think he was too busy being worried for Ross to think about taking a cupcake. That leaves you, young man. Why did you break the rules?\u201d\n\nMore scowls from Caedon. \u201cWell, we never got to finish playing our game outside because Ross got stung by that dumb bee. I was gonna win; I know I was! When I saw the cupcakes, I decided a deserved a prize because I woulda won if we got to finish the game. I didn\u2019t think you would notice that one was missing.\u201d He hung his head in shame.\n\n\u201cWell, I did. And no matter what, it was still against the rules and you know that. So,\nwhat did you do with the cupcake?\u201d After a moment of hesitation, Caedon walked over to Angelica\u2019s little kitchen set, and pulled the cupcake out of the oven.\n\n\u201cAfter Ross came down, everyone was looking at his bee sting, so I snuck it in here when you were upstairs. I was saving it for later cuz I didn\u2019t want anyone to see me eating it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you for being honest with me, Caedon, but there are still consequences for breaking the rules.\u201d Leslie said, retrieving the cupcake from Caedon\u2019s grasp.\n\nCaedon wasn\u2019t able to enjoy any of the baked treats with the others that afternoon, but he did learned a valuable lesson.

The intensity in the air was so thick it could be cut with a knife. Everyone who had come to the celebration (or had some involvement in it) had been called to the City Hall\u2019s main room, where they all stood growing into cynics as each person sized up the others in the room. It certainly wasn\u2019t the most comfortable moment in the world, and it got only more stressful when a police officer strode into the City Hall, breaking the silence. \u201cNow what\u2019s the trouble here?\u201d By the look of him, he wasn\u2019t pleased to be there. The question hung in the air for a long time before someone finally answered. \u201cThere was a theft here, sir,\u201d said Frank Thompson, who had been hanging outside the circle of celebrators. He was the head custodian and overall caretaker of the City Hall, and had a very haggard appearance; his gray jumpsuit was patched in several places, and the key chain at his side, heavily burdened with keys, was rusted. The police officer grunted, displeased at such a vague response. \u201cGive me specifics, sir.\u201d \u201cSomeone stole the Veterans\u2019 pins,\u201d broke in Mr. Landry, the son of one of the veterans. His father, who had served since before Vietnam even, had grown too old to speak up for himself and quietly sat in his chair barely looking perturbed. The officer blinked, surprised. \u201cWhat pins?\u201d The veteran\u2019s son gave a brief description of the pins: they were pure gold, decorative pins that were given out every year at the town\u2019s Veterans Day celebration. Except this year, according to Mr. Landry, they were especially important, because they not only highlighted the services of the veterans (which they always did), but they also celebrated the town\u2019s tenth successful Veterans Day celebration. In the past, the small town had been without the funds to throw such events. But beginning a decade ago, they started doing better financially, and the party seemed more extravagant every year. \u201cWhy would someone want to steal the pins?\u201d asked the officer, eying the empty box that he presumed had once contained the ceremonial objects. \u201cI assume they\u2019d be worth a significant sum,\u201d answered Colonel Abraham in a curt tone. Colonel Abraham, a well-known member of the community, had also served in Vietnam. He was among the minority who actually enlisted in the army rather than being drafted. He was a very strong looking man, even in his old age, and he had never seemed to be very nice. There was always a scowl sewn onto his face. \u201cProbably,\u201d agreed the officer, who had stepped through the crowd to examine the box more closely. It was a simple cardboard box, with no corporate insignia on the outside. \u201cWho was the one who brought the box?\u201d he asked. A small, timid delivery boy stepped forward. He shivered as he looked up into the officer\u2019s eyes. \u201cThat would be me, s-sir,\u201d he stuttered. \u201cI reckon it was that boy who took \u2019em,\u201d spat the colonel, glaring at the delivery boy. \u201cHe was the first person to be in contact with them. Selfish punk trying to earn a quick buck, huh?\u201d \u201cN-no! It wasn\u2019t me, I s-swear!\u201d he answered. \u201cQuiet, kid,\u201d said the officer bluntly. \u201cWell what about the Landry boy?\u201d yelled the custodian, key chain jangling. \u201cI bet because of how highly he thinks of his daddy, he stole the pins to give them all to him!\u201d \u201cI would never do that,\u201d Mr. Landry responded. \u201cMy father would rather not be given a pin, I have to talk him into coming to this celebration every year. You probably had one of the best opportunities to steal the pins, Frank. Or maybe it was you, Colonel?\u201d He turned to the rugged veteran, cheeks red. \u201cWe all know about how highly you think of yourself and your services; who\u2019s to say you didn\u2019t do it?\u201d The Colonel, who had grabbed the delivery boy out of anger while Landry spoke, opened his mouth to speak before he was interrupted by the police officer. \u201cEnough. All of you go into the other room until I call you back in. I\u2019d like to speak to the Colonel, the delivery boy (\u201cRyan Smith,\u201d the boy muttered, feeling resentment when his name was not acknowledged), Mr. Landry and Frank Thompson right now. Gentlemen, please remain here with me.\u201d When everyone else had scurried out of the room, the police officer took a deep breath. Before he addressed the men, he noticed a plug of tobacco near the cardboard box. He picked it up and pocketed it. \u201cSo earlier today, Ryan Smith here, the delivery boy, brought the box of pins to City Hall to be handed out to the veterans. Is this correct?\u201d Ryan, along with Mr. Landry, nodded. \u201cWhat happened to the box once it arrived here at City Hall?\u201d asked the officer. \u201cWe opened it to check that the engraving on the pins was correct, and then we went to lock them up,\u201d answered Mr. Landry. \u201cOnly the custodian has the key to that room.\u201d The officer asked, \u201cSo the missing pins were locked away, until ...?\u201d \u201cUntil I was sent to get them,\u201d finished Colonel Abraham, whose statement was punctuated by the sound of the custodian spitting chewed tobacco into a nearby cup. \u201cDid you get the key from the custodian?\u201d asked the officer. \u201cYes,\u201d he answered. \u201cAnd when I unlocked the room, the box was empty.\u201d The police officer grimaced when the custodian spat more chewed tobacco into a cup. \u201cWill you stop that, sir? It\u2019s disgusting. Not to mention very unhealthy, you know.\u201d \u201cSorry sir, the Colonel here got me into the habit. I don\u2019t normally chew, all I have is what\u2019s in my mouth, which the Colonel gave me a little earlier,\u201d the custodian said, slightly digressing. Struck by a sudden revelation, the police officer smirked. \u201cI think I know who did it.\u201d Who stole the pins?\nAnswer:","targets":["\u201cColonel Abraham, I am afraid you\u2019ll have to go down to the station with me,\u201d said the officer.\n\nThe Colonel blinked in amazement, his scowl fading to be replaced with a look of surprise. \u201cWhat? How did you know it was me?\u201d He winced as if shot when he realized he had just confirmed the police officer\u2019s accusation.\n\nThe officer took a deep breath. \u201cThough the delivery boy had ample opportunity to steal the pins before delivery, the custodian and Mr. Landry both saw the pins, to check the engraving, after he delivered them. You, Colonel, borrowed the key from the custodian to get the box, but you left something behind in your haste. This!\u201d He took out the plug of tobacco. \u201cThough you are not presently chewing any, the custodian has only the tobacco in his mouth. You supplied him, so it\u2019s likely that you are the one who would accidentally leave around unused tobacco. It could easily have fallen out of your pocket.\u201d\n\nThe Colonel looked bemused, but could not hide the defeat on his face. \u201cFine, officer, I think I\u2019ll retain as much honor as I can.\u201d In the next ten minutes the pins had been brought back from the Colonel\u2019s truck, and then Colonel Abraham was taken down to the police station.\n\n\u201cHope you had a nice Veterans Day,\u201d said the officer as he closed the cell door."],"multiple_choice_targets":[],"multiple_choice_scores":[],"idx":49,"is_generated":false,"true_idx":49},{"inputs":"Story: Janice Cummings was excited. As the youth director for a new church in Overland Park, Kansas, she would host the church\u2019s first youth sleep over. The little church had been open for six months, and still, the membership was less than 100. Though for the first time, Janice felt the church was coming together as a viable congregation. This pleased her, as the Christmas season was less than a month away. The congregation had purchased an old church building on the outskirts of Overland Park. The building was constructed in the 1930s and very old fashioned by modern standards. An old cemetery behind the churchyard reminded Janice that this institution was from a different time and way of life. The building itself was square-shaped, consisting of the sanctuary with rooms and offices on either side. A small kitchen was tucked away in back of the choir area. And that was it. Tonight, Janice would supervise the youth sleep over. There would be five kids in attendance. Janelle, Heather and Allison would sleep in a classroom on the right side of the sanctuary. Justin and Josh would sleep in a different classroom, across on the left side. Janice would sleep on the couch in the pastor\u2019s office, which was also on the left side of the sanctuary. She knew better, though, than to believe anyone would be sleeping much. Janelle Herbst, 18, was the oldest of the girls. Janelle wore a walking cast on a very painful broken ankle and could barely walk. She was in obvious pain but was determined to spend the night with her friends. Heather Guse, a serious and intense girl, was a year younger and hoped to enroll in seminary next year after graduating from high school. Heather\u2019s lifelong dream was to follow her dad into ministry. Her father was an ordained minister and a friend of Janice\u2019s boss, Pastor Brian Huseby. Justin Paul, 13, was the newest youth member. He seemed nervous, but Janice assumed it was because he didn\u2019t know the older youth and, perhaps, he did not feel well. Justin had undergone sinus surgery recently and experienced discomfort in breathing. Josh Darvin, 15, was a quiet boy who never said much, though he could be rambunctious and was liked by the other kids. Allison, 17, was the mischievous one. Janice made a mental note to keep a close eye on her. At 6:00 p.m., Pastor Brian served communion in the sanctuary. The silver wine chalice and bread tray were the first gifts the new congregation had received and Pastor Brian was fiercely proud of them. They were on permanent display by the speaker\u2019s podium. Communion was served by the intinction method \u2013 in which the sacraments are served by dipping the wafer or bread in the communal wine cup. During communion, Janice noticed that Justin had not removed his heavy coat, which was quite baggy on his thin frame. Janice and the kids prepared a snack supper at 7:00 p.m. The rest of the evening, and on until the early morning, was spent in fellowship, game playing and discussing the future of their new church. Josh was in an especially good mood and enjoyed teasing the others with his flashlight. None of the others, including Janice, had remembered to bring a flashlight and Josh wasted no opportunity to remind them of this. But, finally, the young people tired. Around 3:00 a.m., they were finally asleep. At 4:00 a.m. Janice awoke to loud snoring near her on the left side of the sanctuary. A moment later, she thought she heard a faint noise coming from the sanctuary. She suspected a mouse nosing around the communion wafers. Janice briefly considered getting up to take a look around, but knew that it was totally dark in there with no night lights of any kind. After these disruptions, she slept soundly until 8:00 a.m., when Allison woke her. Allison and the other girls had slept in the rooms opposite the boys and Janice. Allison had to cross through the sanctuary to wake Janice and noticed the communion items missing. She mentioned this to Janice after waking her. \u201cYeah, right,\u201d Janice said, teasingly, remembering Allison as the free spirited one in the group. \u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d The tone in Allison\u2019s voice told Janice that she was not joking. After checking out the altar, Allison\u2019s claim was confirmed. Janice asked her, \u201cWho took the communion set?\u201d Even the leftover crackers and grape juice were missing. Allison replied, \u201cYou\u2019re probably thinking it was me.\u201d \u201cWas it you?\u201d \u201cNo, but I was up around 5:00 o\u2019clock to go to the bathroom.\u201d The tiny bathroom was to the right side of the front door \u2013 the side of the sanctuary where the girls spent the night. Allison would have exited her room, turned left and walked down the side aisle to the bathroom. This could be accomplished in the dark sanctuary, but with difficulty, as she pointed out. \u201cI even stubbed my toe on the side of a pew. The lower legs are made of metal and it hurts.\u201d Allison showed Janice the fresh, ugly bruise on her right, big toe. She added, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have hurt my toe against the wall if I was feeling my way along it with my hands.\u201d Janice thought for a moment and then told Allison. \u201cGet everybody together. This is not funny. And I think I know who took the communion set.\u201d Who is responsible?\nAnswer:","targets":["Janice explained to the kids why they had been called to a meeting. \u201cOne of you took the communion service set from the altar.\u201d The kids gave Janice a blank look as she continued: \u201cNo doubt this is a practical joke, but I\u2019m not amused. This is the house of the Lord and everything in here belongs to Him.\u201d\n\nAllison asked, \u201cSo, who do you think took it?\u201d\n\nJanice gave a stern look to the guilty party, who said, \u201cIt was just a joke. I\u2019ll put it back. But, how did you know it was me?\u201d\n\nJanice looked at Allison and said, \u201cI knew it wasn\u2019t you. You explained to me how you got that nasty bruise on your right toe. Had you left your room and turned right towards the altar, chances are slim you would have bruised your toe that way on the wall.\u201d\n\nJanice looked next at Janelle. \u201cYou didn\u2019t take the communion set, either. You can barely move with that broken ankle. There is no way you could move about in a dark room in pain and not make a substantial noise.\u201d Janelle nodded her head.\n\nLooking at Justin, Janice said, \u201cI heard snoring just before hearing a faint noise around 4:00 o\u2019clock. Your sinus surgery served you well this morning, Justin. Besides, I noticed you still had on your heavy coat during communion. I knew you must have been running a fever. I am confident that playing a practical joke was the last thing on your mind when going to bed.\u201d Justin was stunned, and said nothing.\n\nShe said to Heather, \u201cI know how important seminary and becoming a pastor are to you. I doubt you would jeopardize that with a practical joke such as this. Besides, joking just does not fit your personality.\u201d\n\nFinally, looking at Josh, she said, \u201cYou were in a playful mood last night. You had a flashlight \u2013 the only flashlight -- and could easily see what you were doing. But, even if you were not the only one with a flashlight, I would still know it was you, because it could not be any of the others.\u201d\n\nHe replied, soberly, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean any harm. The service is in Justin\u2019s big coat pocket. I ate the crackers and drank the grape juice.\u201d\n\nJanice thought for a moment, and then replied, softly, \u201cAnd no real harm was done. But, this is the Lord\u2019s house and He is not to be mocked.\u201d Pausing for a moment, she continued with emphasis, \u201cYou drank the blood and ate the body of Christ out of proper context. That is wrong.\u201d\n\nJosh, now visibly shaken, asked, \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Janice took a moment before answering. \u201cNothing,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cNothing?\u201d Josh asked, incredulously. He was used to harsh, unforgiving school administrators. \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\nJanice smiled a thin smile. She said, \u201cDon\u2019t you remember your Sunday school lessons?

His five children were with him at bedside on the last morning of his life. The years had not been kind to Harold. Since the death of his beloved wife Susie a decade ago, he had commenced a long and agonizing slide into Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The family knew that his passing would be a blessing. But on this last morning in late winter, Harold was surprisingly lucid. He began to talk, and told his children of people and experiences they had never heard him speak of before. It seemed that Harold had mercifully been relieved of dementia in this short time before joining Susie in eternity. The children would later be thankful for and cherish this last quality time spent with their father. Less than an hour before Harold died, he said to his children, \u201cThey say a candle burns brightest before flickering out. That\u2019s what I\u2019m doing, flickering out. But, before I depart this life, I have something to tell you. I would have told you this long ago, but haven\u2019t been quite able to.\u201d It was the first time in many years the children had experienced their dad\u2019s wry humor\u2014something else to be thankful for on this day. But, he continued, \u201cIn the basement of the house there is an old steamer trunk back in the far corner, to the right of the entry way. It\u2019s buried under a mountain of stuff Mom and I collected over the years, but you need to find it. Inside the trunk, there\u2019s some information you need to know.\u201d Dennis, the oldest of the Boyles children, asked, \u201cWhat kind of information?\u201d \u201cFind the trunk and you\u2019ll find out.\u201d Harold refused to talk about it anymore and passed away peacefully a few minutes later. A couple of weeks later, the children met in their childhood home to find the trunk. They were not certain it even existed, as Harold\u2019s memory was not to be trusted, but they could not chance assuming he imagined the \u201cinformation you need to know.\u201d After digging through all the collected family debris in the basement, they finally found the steamer trunk Harold promised would be there. They dusted it off and carried it upstairs to open it in the dining room. The dining room table was big enough to accommodate whatever contents they would find in the old chest. At first glance, the contents of the trunk appeared to be insignificant. There were a couple of World War II era newspapers and a Life magazine with Eisenhower (then General Eisenhower) on the cover. There were a few old love letters Mom had saved which Harold had written to her in the thirties. There were a couple of prescription medicine pill bottles dated October, 1946 and a few pieces of cheap costume jewelry. And that was all, except for an envelope with a letter inside. It was addressed to Harold Boyles and postmarked August 25, 1969. Dennis opened the letter and read it aloud: Harold; You have a sick child. I know which one of them poisoned Ethel. I saw the poison being placed in the bottle of salad dressing she used. However, $10,000 will make this memory go away. Roscoe The five sat around the table in silence. If this letter from forty years ago was true, one of them was a murderer. Their Aunt Ethel died in 1968 from what was believed acute food poisoning. Uncle Roscoe had never remarried and they wondered if this was a letter from an embittered, heartbroken man. Still, it was not an accusation they could ignore. Dennis said, \u201cI\u2019m seventy years old and Patricia is the youngest at fifty-eight. Any of us could have murdered Aunt Ethel, if that is indeed what happened.\u201d They continued to sit in stunned silence. Dennis said, \u201cI remember when Auntie got sick. It was at the July Fourth pool party we had here. I thought it was odd that nobody else was affected, but we were later told that she was the only one who used salad dressing from the bottle that was spoiled. I recall now it was her special brand that nobody else liked. If what Uncle Roscoe claims is true, one of us had to have placed poison in the bottle in the kitchen before Mom took the food outside to the pool deck. There was no way to do it outside unnoticed.\u201d George added, softly, \u201cI remember that Aunt Ethel was not a nice person. She always scowled and lost her temper with us when Mom and Dad were not around.\u201d \u201cYou saying one of us paid her back?\u201d asked John, incredulously. \u201cCould be.\u201d Patrick, age sixty-eight, said, \u201cDad would not have kept this letter and pointed us to it if there was nothing to the accusation.\u201d Patricia (Trish, as her brothers called her) said, \u201cYou know we can never rest until we figure this out.\u201d She shuddered. \u201cIf true, this is terrible.\u201d George, age sixty-five and recently retired, said, \u201cI was the first to arrive that day. Remember, it was a cookout and swim party. I\u2019ve always loved the pool and wanted to get here early for a private swim. The first thing I did when I got here was wave hello to Mom through the window in the kitchen. I saw Dad was with her. Then, after diving into the pool, I gashed my finger on the intake grill and spent the rest of the day with a bandage on my hand.\u201d Patrick spoke next. \u201cI arrived with my wife and our little Alice. George was already bandaged and not looking too happy. First we went to the kitchen to say hi to Mom and Dad. Mom was preparing the condiment tray. The spoiled bottle of dressing was with the other condiments, but it was sealed with the top screwed on.\u201d Trish said, \u201cI remember coming in through the backyard gate. I do recall seeing the condiment tray through the kitchen window\u2014unattended on the kitchen table. Now, I did not go into the kitchen at any time that day. All of you should remember that as I was never by myself all day long. But, while I was looking in the window, Roscoe and Ethel walked up behind me and said hi. I turned around to greet them. I would bet that Roscoe saw somebody handle the salad dressing and later put two and two together.\u201d John, sixty-one, and the quietest of the siblings, spoke next. \u201cI was frying hamburgers outside. Roscoe and Ethel came over to me when they arrived and we visited for awhile. After a time, they went over to the pool area and I saw them speaking with Trish. I would agree that was probably when Roscoe saw something in the kitchen, because he was facing the window and, soon after that, the burgers were done so Mom brought the tray outside.\u201d Dennis was the last to speak. He waited for a few long moments, collecting his memories from forty years ago. Finally, he said, \u201cWell, my family and I arrived pretty much unnoticed, coming in through the back gate as Trish did and walking in just as Roscoe and Aunt Ethel were speaking with her. I noticed Alice getting ready to jump into the pool and Patrick\u2019s wife was taking a seat by the pool. I knew she could not swim so I jumped in to play with Alice. We stayed in the pool until it was time to eat.\u201d The next voice spoke quickly. Looking at the guilty sibling, the voice said, \u201cI know you did this. Would you like to tell the rest of us why?

Friday and Saturday featured important events for many of the high school sports teams. Specifically, the last football game was scheduled on Friday night, and the Chagrin Invitational Wrestling Tournament was held on Friday and Saturday. Though, all games and competitions ended by 3:00 p.m. on Saturday. Everyone -- parents and kids alike -- needed time to prepare for the big Fall Festival Dance, held Saturday night. While mothers are well known for being incredibly sentimental as their children grow up, the truth is that fathers are just as emotional. Sure, we may not want to talk about our feelings out loud. And we certainly don\u2019t get all giddy as our children get dressed up for special occasions. But, inside, we secretly take great pride in seeing the amazing young adults that our children are becoming. In fact, that was exactly what I was thinking while I watched a pack of gushy mothers take picture after picture of our children as they were about to head to dinner, before the big dance. (That, plus how I was going to get a digital copy of those pictures.) As the kids got into the limo, I thought what an amazing evening my son, RJ, had ahead of him. He was with Diane, a girl he really liked. And it was apparent that she really liked him, too. Diane had worked miracles for my son\u2019s health and eating habits. He had always had a huge sweet tooth, but since Diane was a diabetic who could not eat sweets, he had stopped eating them as well in support of her. RJ and Diane were going to the dance with three other couples. This was their first formal dance and the parents had spared no expense. We had rented them a limo so that they did not have to be driven by parents. The children planned to go to a nice dinner prior to the dance. The boys had even taken dance classes in order to surprise the girls with their newfound rhythm. I had no idea how the football coach had gotten the entire team to agree to it, but something told me it had a lot to do with a choice between dance lessons or lots and lots of extra laps at practice. Even more amazing was that, as far as I knew, the entire team had managed to keep it a secret from the girls. Fortunately for me, I was one of the lucky parents picked to be a chaperone. The dance went from 9:00 p.m. until 1:00 a.m., and I had the first shift, from nine o\u2019clock to eleven. I got there early so that I could watch the couples arrive. Principal Whittenmeyer cornered me as I walked in the door. Each year, he made the punch for the event. He was so proud of his \u201csecret formula\u201d (and no one had the heart to tell him that we all knew that it was just Kool-Aid). As I walked in the door, he relayed that this year, he planned to give every student a Breathalyzer to test for alcohol, before they were allowed to enter the dance. I thought that was a great idea, especially because that meant that he would be guarding the door all night. That meant that I was not going to have to talk to him all night. He then pointed me towards the punch and watched as I sipped from the plastic cup. I smiled and gave him a reassuring thumbs-up. (Yes, it was Kool-Aid again this year.) I took my cup and moved to the other side of the gym to watch as everyone arrived. It was fun to observe this great occasion, as all of the children I had known since they were in kindergarten came in dressed up for their first formal event. One of the first students to arrive was Carole. Carole had always been one of my favorite kids. However, for some reason, Carole could never seem to get a date. This night, she arrived at the dance by herself. While most of the girls with dates were arriving without coats, Carole had worn one. When she took her coat off near the punchbowl, I was very pleased to see that even though she had no date, she had still taken great care to dress up for the dance. Since she and RJ had been friends for years, I hoped that RJ would ask her to dance at least one dance during the night. And let me tell you, I almost had a heart attack when I saw Dan OKane. Dan was a junior who was nationally ranked as a wrestler. Like every other year, he dropped as much weight as he could in order to get into the lowest possible weight class. This was the first time I had ever seen him in anything other than a sweat suit during wrestling season. He lived in one of those plastic suits that allowed athletes to sweat constantly. Yet, here he was in a suit and tie, looking smashing. I bet his parents were really proud of him. As was his nature to be helpful, Dan was constantly getting punch for everyone and he spent a lot of time by the punch bowl talking to his friends. That was when RJ and his group finally arrived. They obviously had a wonderful time at dinner as they were all laughing and smiling when they arrived. After passing through the breath test, they were all directed by Principal Whittenmeyer to the punch bowl. Soon after that, I saw Diane passing out punch to everyone. I did my best to play it cool and not go over and talk with all of the kids I knew. Fortunately, many of them stopped over during the night to say a quick hello. Even RJ stopped by about an hour into the dance. He was standing there talking to me when he suddenly felt a sharp pain in his stomach. It seemed as if he had eaten something that did not agree with him. I started to ask what he had for dinner when I noticed that most of the students were also clutching their stomachs in pain. As I looked around the room, it quickly became apparent that there were only five people who were unaffected and I was one of them. Dan quickly walked away from the punch bowl and headed over to where I was, stopping to get Carole and Diane on the way. There were three of the four other unaffected people. Principal Whittenmeyer, the last healthy person, saw everyone converging on me and walked over as well. Very quickly we realized that someone had spiked the punch. Since I had been the first one to have some and I had not gotten sick, it certainly looked as if I had done something to the punch to make everyone sick. Before anyone did anything foolish, I pulled out my cell phone and called 911. As the paramedics were taking care of everyone, the police arrived to question everyone. I walked up to the police and told them that I already knew who had spiked the punch bowl.

As usual, five middle school students were waiting for him at the stop: Marty Nolan, his brother Johnny, Lyle Esposito, Chloe Streamer and Susan Moorgate. Just as usual, the kids were rambunctiously yelling and pushing at each other, as Ed pulled up in a cloud of diesel fumes. Ed Tuttle was a former police officer, driving the school bus in his retirement years to supplement his pension, and the students respected the big, burly ex-cop. Some of the children even downright feared him. \u201cMorning, Mr. Tuttle,\u201d Marty Nolan said politely, the first of the five to board the bus. The stocky thirteen year-old had his hockey bag looped over his shoulder. The large bag bulged tight with equipment, wedging against the handrails in the stairwell of the bus. \u201cGame tonight?\u201d Ed asked. \u201cYou bet, Mr. Tuttle,\u201d Marty responded enthusiastically. \u201cWe\u2019re whipping Glenford tonight.\u201d Ed smiled. He admired the kid\u2019s spirit, if not his playing ability, which consisted mainly of elbows and stick work. \u201cPut the bag under your seat, okay?\u201d Marty nodded and crab-walked down the aisle of the bus. Lyle Esposito was next on board, carrying his French horn. He said hello to Ed, then stumbled on a step and sprawled headlong in front of the man. His French horn case broke open to reveal the large golden instrument inside. It was packed tight into the case\u2019s molded, red velvet lining, so it wouldn\u2019t rattle around and get damaged when carried. As a result, it stayed stuck in the form fitting lining now, preventing it from flying out and hitting the aisle or Ed. \u201cCareful with that, son,\u201d Ed said. \u201cClasp it back together and then stow it under your seat.\u201d Lyle nodded, red-faced. He secured the heavy case and hefted it down the aisle to where Marty was sitting and laughing. \u201cHi, Mr. Tuttle!\u201d Susan Moorgate sang out, running up the steps, her small Hello Kitty lunchbox rattling. A notorious tattletale, Susan said, \u201cI\u2019ll be sure to let you know if anyone misbehaves on the ride into the city, Mr. Tuttle!\u201d Ed gave the redheaded twelve year-old a tight smile as she skipped past. Chloe Streamer trudged up the steps next, a large backpack strapped to her back. She turned to snip at Johnny Nolan behind her. \u201cI still say Mrs. Murphy only picked you for first flute because she wanted a token boy in the front row.\u201d The girl sniffed and turned back around, smiling sweetly at Ed. Finally, Johnny Nolan climbed aboard the bus, his small flute case in one hand and his lunchbox in the other. \u201cMr. Tuttle,\u201d he said, serious as always. The thin, brown-haired twelve year-old was actually a very good flutist; Ed had heard his solo during a recent school band concert and been impressed. Now, he pulled the door shut and shifted the bus into gear. \u201cHey, look everybody, it\u2019s Zamfir!\u201d Marty yelled at the other kids, as Johnny walked down the aisle and sat down in an empty seat. Macho Marty was always making fun of his kid brother for playing the flute, a musical instrument he considered \u2018unmanly\u2019. Ed locked eyes with the loudmouth in his rearview mirror, and Marty sheepishly grinned and shut his mouth. Ed tromped on the accelerator, headed for Point West Middle School ten miles away. Johnny sat by himself on the right-hand side of the bus, near the back, his lunchbox clasped next to him on the seat, flute case between his feet on the floor. Chloe and Susan sat on the padded bench seat in front of him. Behind him sat Lyle and Marty. Chloe promptly popped up and stuck out her tongue at Johnny. \u201cTeacher\u2019s pet!\u201d she sneered. Johnny kicked the back of the seat, making both girls scream. Ed\u2019s reflected eyes glared at them, and Susan pointed an accusing finger back at Johnny. \u201cWhoever heard of a guy playing a flute, anyway?\u201d Marty piped up from in back of his brother. \u201cRight, Lyle?\u201d He jabbed his buddy in the ribs, practicing his hockey moves. Lyle nodded, grinning. \u201cIt is kind of feminine,\u201d the lanky, curly-haired teen agreed. The bus hit a pothole, and everyone jumped a foot or so off their seats. \u201cAt least I don\u2019t play the French horn,\u201d Johnny retaliated, glancing back at Lyle. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky if you get five notes a concert. Just as well, too, from what I hear.\u201d Lyle blushed and kicked the back of Johnny\u2019s seat. Like all good bus drivers, Ed kept one eye on the road and one on his rearview mirror as he drove, checking on the kids he was carrying. But no one committed the cardinal sin of standing up and moving around while the bus was in motion on that last fifteen-minute leg into the city. That\u2019s why Ed was more than a little surprised when he braked to a stop in the bus loop in front of Point West School and Johnny suddenly shouted from the back, \u201cHey, somebody stole my flute!\u201d Cop reactions instantly kicking in, Ed jumped out of his seat, spun around and yelled, \u201cFreeze!\u201d Halting all the bus riders in mid get-up. His shrewd, police-trained eyes took in the layout, and then he further barked, \u201cOkay, everybody off! Chloe, Susan, Johnny, Marty and Lyle last!\u201d Ed watched the other kids get off the bus and race for the front doors of the school. Then he beckoned at the remaining five students, and they disembarked along with him. Chloe clung to her backpack, Susan hugging her lunchbox to her chest, the pair scared. Marty, on the other hand, was grinning as he wrestled his bulging equipment bag off the bus, his black hockey helmet on his head. \u201cFigured I might need this,\u201d he joked, tapping the helmet. \u201cIn case things get too rough.\u201d Lyle bumped his French horn case down the stairs, followed by Johnny, carrying just his lunchbox now. \u201cWhy are you only stopping them, Mr. Tuttle?\u201d he asked. \u201cSome other kid might\u2019ve taken my flute.\u201d Ed shook his head, looking over the four suspects lined up in front of him. \u201cNo one stood up or crossed the aisle after you five came on board at the last stop, meaning someone directly in front of or behind you has to have taken your flute. What were you doing, by the way, that you didn\u2019t notice it go missing?\u201d \u201cSleeping,\u201d Johnny admitted. Chloe laughed. \u201cDo you know who took Johnny\u2019s flute, Susan?\u201d Ed interrogated. The freckle-faced youngster gulped, shook her head. Ed\u2019s hard eyes traveled over the four students, his cop brain working, looking for clues. \u201cSearch them!\u201d Johnny suggested. \u201cIf only I had that authority,\u201d the man mused, \u201clike in the old days.\u201d Just then the school bell went off, signaling the start of classes for the day. Ed snapped his fingers. \u201cI know who took your flute, Johnny,\u201d the grizzled ex-cop growled. \u201cSure, I know, Johnny.\u201d Who stole the flute?\nAnswer:","targets":["The person who took Johnny\u2019s flute had to have a bag, backpack or box large enough to conceal the unscrewed flute in its case.

All of his students had worked very hard this year and Gary considered this class the best he had ever had scholastically. That was indeed high praise, as Gary was nearing retirement from a 35-year teaching career. As final exams in all classes loomed near, Gary\u2019s students were becoming increasingly stressed and tension filled the air. Today, Gary decided to tell them a Patrick Family story, one he had never shared with anybody outside of his immediate family. He wanted to do this for two reasons: his students deserved a reward for a good school year plus he wanted them to relax for a little while and relish an interesting story. An interesting story it was. Gary was entering the seventh grade in 1962 when he first heard the story told by his grandfather, Tom Patrick, Jr. At that time, \u201cGranddad\u201d as he was called, told him he had heard the story himself at age 13 when his own father, Tom Sr., relayed it to him. It was the year 1900 and Tom Sr., was 69 years old and nearing death. He wanted to get the story out while there was still time. Gary reflected often upon the state of the Old South after the Civil War. Older men would marry very young girls for a number of reasons, one being the protection of family property but another, more somber, was the fact that there was a dire shortage of young men in both the north and south after the war was over. The war had taken a tragic, terrible, human toll on both sides. Gary shared his thoughts concerning this with the class. First he attempted to link the present day with that time by relating an interesting tidbit concerning the recently deceased Senator Strom Thurmond. \u201cStrom Thurmond, as most of you know, was a southern senator from South Carolina and 100 years old when he died. When Thurmond first ran for public office in 1929, he ran for county judge and his main campaign strategy was to court the vote of Civil War Veterans. That doesn\u2019t have anything to do with my story, but it puts some context to the time between then and now.\u201d \u201cGranddad Patrick\u2019s story is grim, but very interesting and I have worked it into a mystery. At the end of my tale, I want to see if you can figure out who the guilty party was.\u201d Gary had achieved his goal. The entire class was sitting up straight, alert and hanging on his every word. He began. \u201cIn the spring of 1862, the 11th Texas Cavalry headed east of the Mississippi River for the first time. Along the way, they picked up horses and volunteers. That is where Great Grandfather Patrick enters the story. He owned a farm in Russellville, Arkansas and joined the confederates, bringing his stable of six horses to the cause. Late that summer, he was captured by the Northern Army at the battle of Richmond, Kentucky, when his horse was shot from underneath him. For the remainder of the war, he spent time in Northern prison camps. He was in a camp outside Cincinnati, Ohio for a time before being sent to Elmira, New York, the dreaded \u2018Andersonville of the North\u2019. This is where the rest of the story \u2013 and the mystery \u2013 takes place.\u201d \u201cEverything was in short supply during the War Between the States. Supply and transportation were not nearly as advanced as today and, remember, we were fighting ourselves, not an overseas threat as we face today. Hardship and deprivation come quickly when you are beating yourself up with the viciousness we unleashed in that war.\u201d Gary paused for a moment, catching his breath and emotion. It struck him, as it often did when he told this story, how proud he was to be the descendent of a true \u2018Son of the South\u2019. Continuing, he said, \u201cGreat Grandfather was in a small cell with three other soldiers. It was not much bigger than a broom closet but it was all the Yanks could offer as their own troops were not much better off. Tom and his buddies were given enough food for one man, so they played poker for it. Tom was a good card player and I am glad he was. Were he not, I probably would not be here talking to you now.\u201d Gary paused, wishing to see if that evoked a chuckle from the class. He was pleased that it did not. Gary was deep into his story now and so were his students. He lowered his voice and said, \u201cBut, one night, one of the Yank guards was found dead in Tom and the other\u2019s tiny cell. The guard was dead but there was no apparent reason as to why. But, everyone would know that the guard was more than likely killed for food. Bartering went on all the time in both northern and southern prison camps and was an open secret. The only thing that saved Tom and his friends was the fact they reported it before another Yank discovered it on his own. The guard had been murdered, but which of the four of them did it?\u201d \u201cThis question was bluntly put to them by Sgt. Denny McCool, a wiry, no-nonsense Irisher from New York City. McCool was tough as nails but fair, which was another factor in Tom living to relate this story. It was summer time and he took Tom and the others outside to the prison yard for interrogation. He pointed to the guard tower above them and mentioned, almost off handedly, that he would not hesitate to signal the guards to shoot them all if he did not hear what he wanted to hear.\u201d \u201cSoftly, McCool asked, \u2018What happened?\u2019 Tom later told my grandfather that his soft spoken-ness unnerved them more than bullying or a beating would have. They knew that they had to answer his questions quickly and to the little Irishman\u2019s satisfaction. Tom spoke first, \u2018After evening chow, we always spend time in the courtyard. We always do this as it relieves the stress of being cooped up together. As far as I know, the cell was empty until we gathered in the yard to return to the cell together. We found Corporal Brubaker in our cell, dead.\u2019\u201d \u201cMcCool listened intently. All Tom had said so far was believable. He pointed to the man beside Tom and said, \u2018Who are you?\u2019\u201d \u201cNervously, the rebel soldier replied, \u2018Pvt. Jack Trueblood.\u2019\u201d \u201c\u2018What do you know of this?\u2019\u201d \u201c\u2018Nothing,\u2019 Trueblood answered, cautiously.\u201d \u201c\u2018How about you?\u2019 McCool asked, pointing to Sgt. Patrick Culpepper.\u201d \u201c\u2019I\u2019m Patrick Culpepper, Corp.\u2019 Culpepper hoped that being familiar with a fellow Irishman would help his cause. He could not have been more wrong. Denny McCool, first of Galway, Ireland and then of the New York City Bowery, could smell a con artist a mile away. He was already losing patience with this one.\u201d \u201c\u2019It\u2019s Sergeant McCool, laddie, and don\u2019t make that mistake again.\u2019 Culpepper seemed to shrink into his sole-less boots. McCool asked, \u2018What\u2019s your story?\u2019 Culpepper replied that he didn\u2019t know anything about the dead corporal, either.\u201d \u201cTurning to Private Billy Calhoun, McCool repeated the question, \u2018What do you know of this? You Johnnies better know that Timmy Brubaker was a good friend of mine. Shared more\u2019n one pint with \u2018im back in the day.\u2019\u201d \u201cCalhoun, 21 years old and an illiterate sharecropper\u2019s son from Thurman, Alabama, was so fearful that Tom felt he would collapse. But, he held it together long enough to inform McCool that he, as the others, knew nothing of the corporal\u2019s death.\u201d \u201cMcCool, who after the war would become a history teacher and administrator in the New York City public school system, knew that one of them was lying. It is well known in our family that the only reason Tom lived to tell this tale is because of the thoughtful Irishman\u2019s reason and cool-headedness. He had Tom and the others stand at attention underneath the guard tower while other Yankee blue legs searched their tiny cell. One by one, he had them empty their pockets and remove their filthy clothing for strip searches. McCool was looking for anything that would point to one of them being the killer.\u201d \u201cTom went first. McCool found a small cube of rancid pork in a trouser pocket and an empty tobacco pouch. McCool said to him, dryly \u2018Not having any \u2018baccy can put a man in a mean mood.\u2019 Tom replied, \u2018I haven\u2019t had tobacco or chaw for a long time now.\u2019 Tom thought the saw an ever so slight amusement upon the face of the man who at this moment had the power of life or death over him. Upon inspection of his person, McCool\u2019s men found the usual head lice and body sores caused by filth and malnourishment. But, they found nothing incriminating upon his person or in his clothing.\u201d \u201cNext to be stripped and searched was the terrified Calhoun. Upon his emaciated left bicep was a small bruise, about \u00be of an inch in diameter. There was dirt in both trouser pockets but McCool noticed it had an odd consistency. Calhoun\u2019s boots, like Culpepper\u2019s, were worn to the point that they were uppers only. The soles had completely worn away.\u201d \u201cNext to be inspected was the fearful Trueblood. Trueblood had a cornhusk in his pocket and a dirty, dog-eared diary. Within the diary, McCool noticed that Trueblood wrote only of family and the end of the war. He quickly saw that his fearful demeanor was a facet of a sensitive and thoughtful nature. He also noticed when inspecting his person that his shoulder was discolored from dislocation and a broken wrist was limp and useless. Like the others, they found nothing incriminating upon his person or in his clothing.\u201d \u201cLast to be inspected was the cocky Culpepper. Tom was afraid that he would say something to get them all shot but, mercifully, this did not happen. McCool motioned for Culpepper to step forward but the obnoxious Texan stood motionless. After McCool\u2019s men physically prompted Culpepper to attention with a sharp blow to his belly, Culpepper dropped his cocky fa\u00e7ade and pleaded for mercy from the guards. He cried out an apology and confessed that he did not see the Corporal motion because he was practically blind without his glasses, which had been lost on the battlefield long before he ever reached the camp. Finding nothing in his clothing, McCool seemed satisfied.\u201d \u201cNot long after the questioning and bodily searches ended, McCool received word concerning Corporal Brubaker\u2019s body. A small puncture wound was found in his temple. Beside the body, a rusty nail with blood on it was discovered; no doubt this was the murder weapon. Within his pockets were found a small amount of salt and a half full tobacco pouch. Upon the dirt floor of the tiny prison cell a tattered bag was found; remnants of salt were found within it. An inspection of Brubaker\u2019s body found a small cut on his neck and a small bruise on his right knuckle. His murder had been committed swiftly, silently and efficiently.\u201d \u201cThe yard went deathly quiet as McCool considered everything he had learned. He knew that the prison commandant, Colonel Nix, would be outside soon demanding answers and punishment for the guilty. However, before this happened, McCool pointed to the guilty rebel soldier and said, quietly, \u2018arrest this man.\u2019\u201d Gary fell silent, letting his story sink in to his students. He asked, \u201cAnyone have any idea who the killer was?\u201d Justin Miller, one of Gary\u2019s more astute students, commented, \u201cIt couldn\u2019t have been Tom Patrick. If he had been the murderer, you wouldn\u2019t be here now.\u201d At this, the class roared with laughter, breaking the tension. Even Gary chuckled. But, he replied, \u201cDon\u2019t assume it wasn\u2019t Tom. You have no idea yet what happened to him after this incident.\u201d April Park, another of Gary\u2019s gifted students, correctly chose the guilty confederate and explained her reasoning too. Gary said, \u201cVery good, April. Allow me to finish the story.\u201d Who was the killer?\nAnswer:","targets":["Once more the classroom fell silent. Gary had their undivided attention. He began speaking.\n\n\u201cThe guilty confederate was stunned but retained his composure. A southerner would rather die than show weakness to the hated Yanks. Unfortunately for the murderous Johnny, this is exactly what would happen. He asked, simply, \u201c\u2019How\u2019d ya know?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Weren\u2019t hard, boyo, once I put me thinking cap on.\u2019 McCool was now flushed with emotion and reverted back to Irish dialect. Settling down a bit, he looked at Tom Patrick, saying, \u201cThe corporal was found with \u2018baccy in his pouch. Your pouch is empty. I reckon if you\u2019d killed him, you\u2019d have taken the \u2018baccy. You said it\u2019s been a long time since you had chaw or \u2018baccy and you woulda taken it.\u2019 Glancing at Culpepper, McCool stated, \u2018Now, me Irish lad from Texas can barely see, so he wouldn\u2019t be killing anybody today.\u2019 Pointing at Trueblood, McCool said, \u2018This boy has broken bones and can barely move. He\u2019s no match for the corp.\u2019 Looking back at Tom, he said, \u2018No promises, but I\u2019ll see if the surgeon can look at him.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cMcCool\u2019s eyes now grew cold and steely, as cold as the coastal wind hitting his beloved Galway when he was a lad, before coming to America and getting involved in something far worse than starvation \u2013 bitter civil war. But, he had a job to do and the McCools were known for getting the job done. He pointed to Calhoun and, showing true emotion for the first time, shouted, \u2018You, boyo! You killed the corp. There was an empty salt bag found by his body. That\u2019s why the dirt in your pocket looked and felt strange. You stole his salt and put some of it in your pocket, forgetting about the dirt. But, that bruise on your arm tells the tale, lad. I\u2019ll share a pint with ye if that bruise doesn\u2019t match exactly with the one on the corp\u2019s knuckle. Don\u2019t know how a lad in your weakened state could get the better of him, but I know you rebs are sneaky. Don\u2019t matter too much. You\u2019ll not be around for me to worry about much longer.\u2019\u201d\n\nAFTERWARD\n\nGary had some closing comments for his students.\n\n\u201cCalhoun was executed the next day after Colonel Nix pronounced him guilty. McCool made good on his word to have the prison surgeon attend to Trueblood\u2019s broken bones. This was the beginning of a lifelong friendship between Denny McCool and Tom Patrick, who, after the war, returned home to Arkansas and became Judge Tom Patrick, Justice of the Peace in the small town of London near Russellville. Tom and Denny, for the rest of their lives, kept in regular touch by mail and telegraph. Denny and his wife, Bridget, visited the Patricks in London in 1888. Tom and his wife Marie paid a return visit to New York City in 1889 and again in 1899, a year before his death. Denny McCool always maintained that his friend Tom had to be an Irishman with a last name like Patrick.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you are wondering about the salt, it is not commonly known today that lack of sodium in the human body can create a myriad of problems, including death. One would indeed kill for it in the time and place of our story. Salt deprivation is as serious a problem as scurvy, which is the lack of vitamin C in the human body and another of the many health issues faced by prisoners of war on both sides of the American civil war.\u201d"],"multiple_choice_targets":[],"multiple_choice_scores":[],"idx":84,"is_generated":false,"true_idx":84},{"inputs":"Story: It was only 1:00 p.m. on the first day of the company retreat in Hawaii, but already all the employees from Masterson Technologies had sunburns redder than the volcanic red Hawaiian sea salt they\u2019d sprinkled on their feast at the luau the night before. Craig Willis\u2019 face, however, turned an ashen grey when he saw the dead body in the small pool reserved for Masterson\u2019s top five employees. Well, make that top four. Craig recognized the body as belonging to Trevor Jones, Masterson\u2019s president. A firm believer in remaining physically fit at 50, Trevor\u2019s leadership style reflected his fitness regimen -- no slacking off allowed, period. And since he often extended that to expecting those working under him to work through lunch and not take their rightful breaks, this retreat was the first time he\u2019d ever socialized with his employees. At 32, Craig was a vice president of Masterson Technologies. He didn\u2019t get that high up the corporate ladder that fast by shying away from difficult situations, but his first instinct here was to turn and walk away. A local police officer approached him, pushing all thoughts of running away out of his mind. \u201cI\u2019m Detective Kawika Akana. Are you Craig Willis?\u201d he asked. \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cGood. That means we have all the suspects in one place. Come join your colleagues.\u201d The detective indicated for Craig to go sit with his co-workers at a poolside table. \u201cAre you just going to leave Trevor floating there?\u201d Craig asked. \u201cI\u2019ve already determined that he was murdered,\u201d the detective said. \u201cThe medical examiner will be here soon to confirm that he was forcibly drowned. In the meantime, I\u2019m going to find out which of you killed Mr. Jones \u2026\u201d Craig didn\u2019t know how to reply to that, so he sat down next to Niles Anderson, the company\u2019s 45-year-old accountant. Stephanie Clark, the marketing VP sat on the other side of Niles, and next to her was the office manager, Amanda Kent. Both women were in their fifties, but they couldn\u2019t be more different -- Stephanie an avid cyclist and Amanda an unrepentant couch potato. Detective Akana eyed the four Masterson employees thoughtfully. \u201cSo this is some sort of corporate retreat?\u201d he asked. \u201cYes,\u201d Amanda replied. \u201cI suggested it. The employee morale level is really low. I figured those of us running the company had to improve our work situation first, then maybe our job satisfaction could trickle down through the ranks.\u201d \u201cHah!\u201d Niles said. \u201cYou\u2019re talking like Trevor now.\u201d To Amanda\u2019s questioning look, he explained, \u201cYou said \u2018trickle down through the ranks\u2019 -- that\u2019s Trevor\u2019s army talk.\u201d \u201cWas Mr. Jones in the military?\u201d Akana asked. \u201cNo,\u201d Niles said, \u201cbut his father was. He acted like a drill sergeant more than a businessman. I blame the low morale on him. He never smiled, he never complimented anyone, and he discouraged employee fraternization.\u201d \u201cTruth is,\u201d Amanda said, \u201cthe retreat was meant as an intervention. We were going to try to get him to relax and have fun, then confront him with our gripes.\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d Stephanie said, \u201cwe hoped that outside the office he\u2019d be more open to listening to us.\u201d \u201cBut no such luck,\u201d Craig said. \u201cWe arrived in time for a late dinner yesterday, but he got things off to an uncomfortable start with his sourpuss behavior. He refused to drink the free punch at the luau and rebuffed the pretty dancer who tried to get him on stage, and then this morning he said that he thought this retreat was a waste of time.\u201d \u201cAnd money,\u201d Niles said. \u201cHe counted every penny so many times that he might as well have been doing my job.\u201d \u201cMeaning you\u2019re the accountant?\u201d Akana asked. \u201cYes, and I can assure you that the company will not suffer for this trip. In fact, we all could have brought our spouses without making a dent in the profit margins.\u201d \u201cHmm,\u201d Akana said. \u201cIf the company is doing that well, maybe Jones wasn\u2019t such a bad leader.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s more to life than money,\u201d Craig said. \u201cMr. Jones no longer has a life,\u201d Akana said. After a dead silence, the detective continued. \u201cOkay, so none of you liked him and all of you were with him this morning, correct?\u201d \u201cWell, no,\u201d Niles said, \u201cI met up with everyone at the lunch buffet. I guess I ate some bad Poke last night, because I was up most of the night with stomach pains, then I slept in, and didn\u2019t leave my room until I went to meet everyone for lunch.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not surprised,\u201d Amanda said. \u201cI feel sick just thinking about all the raw fish you ate.\u201d \u201cYou are so old-fashioned,\u201d Stephanie said to Amanda. \u201cEveryone eats sushi nowadays. But maybe that explains it -- you\u2019re afraid of fish!\u201d It was obvious that Stephanie was just ribbing Amanda in a friendly manner, but the office manager seemed embarrassed in front of Akana. \u201cAre we talking about why I won\u2019t go swimming again \u2026 I nearly drowned as a little girl, so what \u2013 I\u2019m terrified of water. But I don\u2019t have a fish phobia. It\u2019s not like I was attacked by a shark or anything. And in case you\u2019ve forgotten, I told you just last night how much I enjoyed the Mahi Mahi.\u201d Stephanie put up her hands in defeat. \u201cOkay, okay, you win. I don\u2019t think the detective wants to hear us two hens going at it, anyway.\u201d Akana smiled. \u201cHowever you normally behave around each other helps me paint a picture of the broader scenario in my mind,\u201d he said. \u201cSo go on \u2026\u201d Amanda grinned. \u201cWell, since she takes such good care of herself, I like to bug her about how great she looks for her age. But I think Stephanie must\u2019ve just dyed the grey out of her hair yesterday because she took special care not to get it wet.\u201d \u201cAmanda!\u201d Stephanie exclaimed. \u201cBut you\u2019re right, I dyed it yesterday and I\u2019m a little concerned about the chlorine because I heard it can turn blonde hair green. Now since you brought up my hair, should we talk about your latest diet \u2026?\u201d \u201cTruce,\u201d Amanda said. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious there\u2019s no love lost with Jones, the way you\u2019re acting like everything\u2019s normal,\u201d Akana said. \u201cGive them a break,\u201d Niles said, \u201ceverybody mourns in their own way.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m just trying not to think about the body,\u201d Craig said, nonetheless glancing at it. \u201cDo we have to sit here much longer?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d Akana said, \u201cI just want to clarify a couple more things. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t Mr. Jones go with you to lunch?\u201d \u201cHe\u2019d decided to swim 100 laps and he intended to finish,\u201d Craig said. \u201cIn fact, he chastised us for not joining him.\u201d \u201cWho was the last person at the pool with him?\u201d \u201cWe all left for lunch together,\u201d Craig said. \u201cBut then we all went to our rooms before meeting back up at the buffet. So I guess that means none of us have an alibi \u2026\u201d \u201cTrue,\u201d Akana said, \u201cbut only one of you is a murderer.

Gary, Ben, Gerald, Mike and Tommy all lived in the same town and had been good friends for over 20 years. They, with their spouses, met often to talk about classic automobiles. The club\u2019s yearly convention and auto show was to be in Springfield next month. And on a beautiful spring evening, the friends met at Ben and Debbie\u2019s home for dinner and conversation. They had much to talk about, as all 10 of them planned to attend the out of town convention. But, Ben had more on his mind than the upcoming convention. He was troubled by something that had happened at the meet last year. Tonight, he would share his concern with the group. After dinner, which had been hamburgers charcoaled on the Hamilton\u2019s outside patio grill, Ben sipped on a Coke and said, \u201cSomeone in our group put a dent in my Corvair\u2019s door at the meet last year. I know who it was but have hoped all of this time that he would come forward and admit it.\u201d Ben paused, measuring his words carefully, and then continued, \u201cIt was on the lower portion of the door and not a serious dent. It was easily repaired, but it kept me out of the competition for Best Restoration.\u201d Everyone, including Debbie, went silent and looked intently at Ben. Ben owned a 1964 Corvair Monza. One of the first American compact cars, it was air cooled with its engine in the rear. Ben\u2019s was a beautiful automobile, which had been restored to pristine condition. It was painted sea green and sported red line tires. It sat low to the ground, which assisted in keeping it stabilized for safety. Rolling (the Corvair had a high center of gravity, causing it to tip over and roll when turning swiftly at high speeds) was the main issue with the Corvair and had been publicized by a well-known consumer advocate, sounding its death knell to the American public. Ben had made certain this issue was addressed with his Monza. Ben surprised the group again by telling them that a week after returning from Springfield last year, he had received an anonymous gift of $250 via money order and an apology for the dent mishap. He knew the unknown offender felt badly about his mistake but did not wish to own up to it. \u201cStill,\u201d he told them, \u201cthis needs to come to light. We are all friends here and I wish for us to remain so. I know the person who sent the money order has felt terrible all year. It\u2019s time to address this and get it behind us.\u201d Tommy Flowers, the owner of a beautiful yellow 1968 Ford Mustang coupe with wide oversize tires, 302 engine, four on the floor transmission and the most emotional of the friends, asked pointedly, \u201cI didn\u2019t know anyone had dented your car. Who was it?\u201d Slowly, Ben answered, \u201cI\u2019m not ready to say. I\u2019m going to explain what happened and see if you can figure it out. I would rather you tell me. I do not wish to accuse an old friend unless it is absolutely necessary.\u201d Gary Riggs, the proud owner of a 1959 Chevrolet Impala four door with pronounced tail fins, offered, \u201cWe all remember that you pulled out of the judging, but you never explained why.\u201d Doc McCroy, the owner of a vintage low slung 1966 Chevrolet Corvette Sting Ray with 427 engine, wire wheels and removable hard top, wasn\u2019t happy either with Ben\u2019s words and said, \u201cOK, Ben, you began this discussion. Start explaining.\u201d Ben replied, \u201cIt was Friday afternoon before the judging on Saturday. I drove over and parked in front of the park pavilion. I went inside to get a Coke from the snack bar. My cell phone rang and I hung around inside for a while. When I came out, there was a nasty dent in the passenger side door. I would have missed it, but the entrance to the pavilion was to the right of the Corvair. I saw it when I came out of the building.\u201d Mike Benson, the least emotional of the friends and owner of a red 1967 Mustang coupe with a black vinyl interior, six cylinder engine and automatic transmission, asked, \u201cDid anyone come in or out of the pavilion while you were there?\u201d \u201cNot that I noticed, but for a short time I was engaged on a business call and was preoccupied.\u201d \u201cSo, you didn\u2019t see anyone?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d answered Ben. \u201cWere there any paint scratches on your door?\u201d \u201cNo. It looked like they had been wiped away.\u201d Ben was silent for a moment, and then offered, \u201cThere was some fresh oil in the parking place next to me. I saw tire tracks. There was nothing unusual about them except that I noticed they were very close to the Corvair.\u201d Doc asked, \u201cDid you notice anything else?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d Everyone sat in silence for a long awkward moment. The wives said nothing, knowing this was something the men would have to work out. Debbie silently prayed that her husband knew what he was doing. Gary finally said, \u201cOK. We need to figure this out. This is disturbing, but you are too old a friend to make this accusation lightly.\u201d Debbie said, \u201cWhen you went to the pavilion, I went with the Riggs to the grocery store. We picked up some chips and Cokes for the snack supper.\u201d Debbie managed a weak grin and said, \u201cRiding in a 1959 Impala is a lot roomier than the Corvair.\u201d Tommy looked at Ben, asking, \u201cMay I ask a couple of questions?\u201d \u201cI wish you would,\u201d replied Ben. Looking at Doc, Tommy asked, \u201cWhere were you that Friday afternoon? \u201cI was washing and waxing the \u2018vette.\u201d Turning to Mike, Tommy asked, \u201cWhat about you? As I recall, you were not at the judging either. Why not?\u201d \u201cWell, I had a radiator leak. Most of you know that cooling systems were and remain the Achilles Heel of the 1960s model Ford Mustangs. I was leaking all the way to Springfield and simply could not get it repaired in time for Saturday.\u201d Tommy considered this for a moment and then said to the group, \u201cI know who did this.
