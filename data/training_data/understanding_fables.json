As the lake was very deep, he was unable to retrieve his tool and sat down on the bank, mourning its loss. Suddenly, Hermes appeared before the woodsman and asked him about the reason for his sadness. After learning about his misfortune, Hermes retrieved a golden ax from the lake, asking the woodsman if it was his. Hearing the woodsman say that it was not, Hermes retrieved a second ax from the lake, one made of silver. The woodsman again said that this was not his tool. Finally, Hermes pulled out the woodman\u2019s ax from the water, who was overjoyed and identified the tool as his own. To reward his honesty, Hermes gave the woodsman all three axes to keep. Some time later, the woodsman told his friends about his encounter with Hermes. One of them headed straight to the same lake, threw his own ax into it, and waited for Hermes to arrive.

There, he came across a tiger, who was lying on the ground, groaning with pain. At first, the slave tried to run away in fear, but soon noticed that the tiger did not chase after him and carefully approached the animal. Noticing the human, the tiger put out a swollen and bloody paw, with a huge thorn stuck in its middle. Seeing this, the slave pulled out the thorn and bandaged up the wound as best he could, thus befriending the tiger who followed him like a friendly dog. The tiger brought the man to his cave and shared his meals with him to show his gratitude. However, after a short while, the two were captured by the man\u2019s former master. As a punishment for his escape, the slave was sentenced to be thrown to the tiger, who was kept without food until that time. The emperor decided to observe the execution. Soon, the slave was led into the middle of an arena, and the tiger was let loose from his cage. But the animal instantly recognized his human companion and licked his hands with devoted affection.
