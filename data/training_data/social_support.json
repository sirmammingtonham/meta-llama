Its a pure physical skill but still relies heavily on elemental damage on gear or gems.  While its not listed as a projectile, it benefits from projectiles damage, Iron Grip (if your bow is physical)  and projectile speed. Its really easy to use it with Point Blank while leveling if your gear is lackluster, and the 100% chance to hit allows you to spare 2 points into resolute technique while benefiting from critical hits.  Dont be afraid from your tooltip DPS though, its wrong!  Point Blank is  a keystone I neglected for a while, I expected the damage bonus to be problematic for reflect, but it turned out to make it easier for me. Playing in melee always happens, and defensive gear isnt that costly. With this build, youre taking survival nodes  because youre going to get hit at some point, so why not benefit from it ? the 50% more increase is huge, roa works really well with point blank, and it doesnt cost much to get it. If youre playing with static blows, youll trigger shock on more targets, and you can reach stun threshold level. Theres no equivalent on the skilltree for such a bonus (outside of pain attunement - and even then it doesnt compare). Against Reflect, as youre going to run in melee range, youll have more time to react, and since youre paying more attention to mob composition, exposure and such, its safer to play with a dangerous playstyle. Against hard physical hitter, you can still benefit from a decent bonus while hitting them with the edge of the aoe, just dont overcommit for the sake of it against Vaal. You need to be melee to snipe loot anyway.   - DefaultPam - exilepro.com  This is where I am getting that information, which hasnt been recently updated.
