Reaching settlement with Appel in 1977, Springsteen returned to the studio, and the subsequent sessions produced ''[[Darkness on the Edge of Town]]'' (1978). Musically, this album was a turning point in Springsteen's career. Gone were the raw, rapid-fire lyrics, outsized characters, and long, multi-part musical compositions of the first three albums; the songs were leaner and more carefully drawn and began to reflect Springsteen's growing intellectual and political awareness.

Noyce's monolithic IC was [[semiconductor device fabrication|fabricated]] using the [[planar process]], developed by his colleague [[Jean Hoerni]] in early 1959. In turn, the planar process was based on Mohamed M. Atalla's work on semiconductor surface passivation by silicon dioxide in the late 1950s.<ref name=\"Lojek120\">{{cite book |last1=Lojek |first1=Bo |title=History of Semiconductor Engineering |url=https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/historysemicondu00loje_697 |url-access=limited |date=2007 |publisher=[[Springer Science & Business Media]] |isbn=9783540342588 |page=[https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/historysemicondu00loje_697\/page\/n128 120]}}<\/ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Bassett |first1=Ross Knox |title=To the Digital Age: Research Labs, Start-up Companies, and the Rise of MOS Technology |date=2007 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=9780801886393 |page=46 |url=https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=UUbB3d2UnaAC&pg=PA46}}<\/ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Huff |first1=Howard R. |last2=Tsuya |first2=H. |last3=G\u00f6sele |first3=U. |title=Silicon Materials Science and Technology: Proceedings of the Eighth International Symposium on Silicon Materials Science and Technology |date=1998 |publisher=[[Electrochemical Society]] |pages=181\u2013182 |isbn=9781566771931 |url=https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=SnQfAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA181}}<\/ref>\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\nModern monolithic ICs are predominantly MOS ([[metal-oxide-semiconductor]]) integrated circuits, built from [[MOSFET]]s (MOS transistors).<ref name=\"Kuo\">{{cite journal |last1=Kuo |first1=Yue |title=Thin Film Transistor Technology\u2014Past, Present, and Future |journal=The Electrochemical Society Interface |date=1 January 2013 |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=55\u201361 |doi=10.1149\/2.F06131if |url=https:\/\/www.electrochem.org\/dl\/interface\/spr\/spr13\/spr13_p055_061.pdf |issn=1064-8208|doi-access=free }}<\/ref> The earliest experimental MOS IC to be fabricated was a 16-transistor chip built by Fred Heiman and Steven Hofstein at [[RCA]] in 1962.<ref name=\"computerhistory-digital\">{{cite web |title=Tortoise of Transistors Wins the Race - CHM Revolution |url=https:\/\/www.computerhistory.org\/revolution\/digital-logic\/12\/279 |website=[[Computer History Museum]] |access-date=22 July 2019}}<\/ref> [[General Microelectronics]] later introduced the first commercial MOS IC in 1964,<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.computerhistory.org\/semiconductor\/timeline\/1964-Commecial.html|title=1964 \u2013 First Commercial MOS IC Introduced|website=[[Computer History Museum]]}}<\/ref> developed by Robert Norman.<ref name=\"computerhistory-digital\"\/> Following the development of the [[self-aligned gate]] (silicon-gate) MOS transistor by Robert Kerwin, [[Donald L.
