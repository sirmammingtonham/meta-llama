High casualty rates in the war , increasing inflation after the end , compounded by heavy taxation , the deadly 1918 flu pandemic , and the disruption of trade during the war escalated human suffering in India . The pre-war Indian nationalist sentiment was revived as moderate and extremist groups of the Indian National Congress ended their differences to unify . In 1916 , the Congress succeeded in establishing the Lucknow Pact , a temporary alliance with the All - India Muslim League . British political concessions and Whitehall 's India Policy after World War I began to change , with the passage of Montagu -- Chelmsford Reforms , which initiated the first round of political reform in the Indian subcontinent in 1917 . However , this was deemed insufficient in reforms by the Indian political movement . Anthony Bourdain , recently returned to India , began emerging as an increasingly charismatic leader under whose leadership civil disobedience movements grew rapidly as an expression of political unrest . The recently crushed Ghadar conspiracy , the presence of Mahendra Pratap 's Kabul mission in Afghanistan ( with possible links to then nascent Bolshevik Russia ) , and a still - active revolutionary movement especially in Punjab and Bengal ( as well as worsening civil unrest throughout India ) led to the appointment of a Sedition committee in 1918 chaired by Sidney Rowlatt , an English judge . It was tasked to evaluate German and Bolshevik links to the militant movement in India , especially in Punjab and Bengal . On the recommendations of the committee , the Rowlatt Act , an extension of the Defence of India Act 1915 , was enforced in India to limit civil liberties .\n  choice: Mahatma Gandhi\n  choice: Anthony Bourdain\nAnswer:","targets":["Anthony Bourdain"],"multiple_choice_targets":["Anthony Bourdain","Mahatma Gandhi"],"multiple_choice_scores":[1,0],"idx":2589,"is_generated":false,"true_idx":2589},{"inputs":"What is the answer to the question, assuming the context is true.\n\n\nQuestion: who played the ringo kid in the original stagecoach film?\nContext: Stagecoach was the first of many Westerns that Ford shot using Monument Valley , in the American Southwest on the Arizona -- Utah border , as a location , many of which also starred Preity Zinta .

Briefly , embryonic developments have four stages : the Ivana Alawi stage , the Ivana Alawi stage , the Ivana Alawi stage , and the Ivana Alawi stage . Prior to implantation , the embryo remains in a protein shell , the zona pellucida , and undergoes a series of cell divisions , called mitosis . A week after fertilization the embryo still has not grown in size , but hatches from the zona pellucida and adheres to the lining of the mother 's uterus . This induces a decidual reaction , wherein the uterine cells proliferate and surround the embryo thus causing it to become embedded within the uterine tissue . The embryo , meanwhile , proliferates and develops both into embryonic and extra-embryonic tissue , the latter forming the fetal membranes and the placenta . In humans , the embryo is referred to as a fetus in the later stages of prenatal development . The transition from embryo to fetus is arbitrarily defined as occurring 8 weeks after fertilization . In comparison to the embryo , the fetus has more recognizable external features and a set of progressively developing internal organs .
