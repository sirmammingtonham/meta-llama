That way he could exit a hero. You suspected all along, suspected he was alive. That's why you came to El Paso. Dunlevy said there was another case, Ron Rice. In fact, there were two earlier cases where serials were murdered. The second was George Sheldon. I didn't enter it into VICAP -- I'll get you the file. How long ago? Both in the last year. I suspected only someone as brilliant as Dick Low could find these guys. Look, whatever Daitz told you, nobody wanted to strip Richard of his badge.

Well--part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long, and make awful messes while they're there. Go on. And they have very mixed feelings about women. They hate them in a way. One reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly and gently. They can scrog them, as you say--  for revenge. You learned this in some college course? I learned a lot of things in college. Actually--it was Norbert who told me that. The doctor. Yes. And what is his most cherished possession? His most cherished possession? His violin, I guess. And he keeps it in his apartment? Yes. And no one's there now? I don't think so. That's too bad.
